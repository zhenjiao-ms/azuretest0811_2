# Title (Maximum 120 characters, target the primary keyword)
*Use 2-3 secondary keywords in the description.*

*Select one of the following disclaimers depending on your scenario. If your article is deployment model agnostic, ignore this.*

[!INCLUDE [learn-about-deployment-models](../../includes/learn-about-deployment-models-rm-include.md)] classic deployment model.

[!INCLUDE [learn-about-deployment-models](../../includes/learn-about-deployment-models-classic-include.md)]

[!INCLUDE [learn-about-deployment-models](../../learn-about-deployment-models-both-include.md)]

[Opening paragraph]

* *Briefly describe the specific issue(s) that this article will help troubleshoot, and the common root cause(s).*
* *The opening paragraph is a good place to use different keywords from those in the title, but make sure to not make it very wordy. The sentences should flow well and be easy to understand.*
* *Exceptions (optional) - List the relevant scenarios that are not covered in this article. For example, ” Linux/OSS scenarios aren't covered in this article”.*

These {errors}|{Issues} occur because {a very general reason}.

*Here is an example of an opening paragraph.*

*When you try to connect to Azure SQL Database, the common connection errors you encounter are:*

* *The login failed for the user. The password change failed.*
* *Password validation failed.*
* *Failed to authorize access to the specified subscription.*

*These errors occur because you don’t have permission to access the data source.*

[!INCLUDE [support-disclaimer](../../includes/support-disclaimer.md)]

## Troubleshooting guidance (optional)
* *Use this section when the guidance applies across the board.*
* *Don’t go into details. Keep it high level to serve as a guidance.*

*Here is an example of a troubleshooting guidance.*

*In general, as long as the error does not indicate "the requested VM size is not supported", you can always retry at a later time, as enough resource may have been freed up in the cluster to accommodate your request. If the problem is the requested VM size is not supported, try a different VM size; otherwise, the only option is to remove the pinning constraint.*

## Troubleshooting steps
*List the solutions in the order of usability and simplicity, meaning the simplest, the most effective and useful solution should go first.*

*Select one of the versions that apply to your situation.*
