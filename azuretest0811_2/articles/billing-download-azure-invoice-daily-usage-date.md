# How to download your Azure billing invoice and daily usage data
As the Azure account administrator, you can view the current bill at the Azure Account Center and download statements for the previous six billing periods as well. Hereâ€™s how:

1. Sign into the [Azure Account Center](https://account.windowsazure.com/subscriptions) as the account administrator. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), you can access the Account Center by selecting **Subscription**>*the subscription name*>**Manage**.
   
   > [!NOTE]
   > Only the  account administrator has permission to access the Account Center. For more information about how to find out who is the account administrator of the subscription, see the [Frequently asked questions](billing-subscription-transfer.md#faq).
   > 
2. Select the subscription for which you want the invoice and usage information.
3. Select **BILLING HISTORY**. </br>![billinghistory](./media/billing-download-azure-invoice-daily-usage-date/Billinghisotry.png)
