# Specifying a Node.js version in an Azure application
When hosting a Node.js application, you may want to ensure that your application uses a specific version of Node.js. There are several ways to accomplish this for applications hosted on Azure.

## Default versions
The Node.js versions provided by Azure are constantly updated. Unless otherwise specified, the default version that is specified in the `WEBSITE_NODE_DEFAULT_VERSION` environment variable will be used. To override this default value, follow the steps in following sections of this article

> [!NOTE]
> If you are hosting your application in an Azure Cloud Service (web or worker role,) and it is the first time you have deployed the application, Azure will attempt to use the same version of Node.js as you have installed on your development environment if it matches one of the default versions available on Azure.

## Versioning with package.json
You can specify the version of Node.js to be used by adding the following to your **package.json** file:

    "engines":{"node":version}

Where *version* is the specific version number to use. You can  can specify more complex conditions for version, such as:

    "engines":{"node": "0.6.22 || 0.8.x"}

Since 0.6.22 is not one of the versions available in the hosting environment, the highest version of the 0.8 series that is available will be used instead - 0.8.4.

## Versioning Websites with App Settings
If you are hosting the application in a Website, you can set the environment variable **WEBSITE_NODE_DEFAULT_VERSION** to the desired version. 

## Versioning Cloud Services with PowerShell
If you are hosting the application in a Cloud Service, and are deploying the application using Azure PowerShell, you can override the default Node.js version by using the **Set-AzureServiceProjectRole** PowerShell cmdlet. For example:

    Set-AzureServiceProjectRole WebRole1 Node 0.8.4

Note the parameters in the above statement are case-sensitive.  You can verify the correct version of Node.js has been selected by checking the **engines** property in your role's **package.json**.

You can also use the **Get-AzureServiceProjectRoleRuntime** to retrieve a list of Node.js versions available for applications hosted as a Cloud Service.  Always verify the version of Node.js your project depends on is in this list.

## Using a custom version with Azure Websites
While Azure provides several default versions of Node.js, you may want to use a version that is not provided by default. If your application is hosted as an Azure Website, you can accomplish this by using the **iisnode.yml** file. The following steps walk through the process of using a custom version of Node.Js with an Azure Website:

1. Create a new directory, and then create a **server.js** file within the directory. The **server.js** file should contain the following:
   
        var http = require('http');
        http.createServer(function(req,res) {
          res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/html'});
          res.end('Hello from Azure running node version: ' + process.version + '</br>');
        }).listen(process.env.PORT || 3000);
   
    This will display the Node.js version being used when you browse the website.
2. Create a new Website and note the name of the site. For example, the following uses the [Azure Command-line tools](xplat-cli-install.md) to create a new Azure Website named **mywebsite**, and then enable a Git repository for the website.
   
        azure site create mywebsite --git
3. Create a new directory named **bin** as a child of the directory containing the **server.js** file.
4. Download the specific version of **node.exe** (the Windows version) that you wish to use with your application. For example, the following uses **curl** to download version 0.8.1:
   
        curl -O http://nodejs.org/dist/v0.8.1/node.exe
   
    Save the **node.exe** file into the **bin** folder created previously.
5. Create an **iisnode.yml** file in the same directory as the **server.js** file, and then add the following content to the **iisnode.yml** file:
   
        nodeProcessCommandLine: "D:\home\site\wwwroot\bin\node.exe"
   
    This path is where the **node.exe** file within your project will be located once you have published your application to the Azure Website.
6. Publish your application. For example, since I created a new website with the --git parameter earlier, the following commands will add the application files to my local Git repository, and then push them to the website repository:
   
        git add .
        git commit -m "testing node v0.8.1"
        git push azure master
   
    After the application has published, open the website in a browser. You should see a message stating "Hello from Azure running node version: v0.8.1".
