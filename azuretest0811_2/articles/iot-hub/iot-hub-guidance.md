# Design your solution
This article provides guidance for how to design the following capabilities in your Internet of Things (IoT) solution:

* Device provisioning
* Field gateways
* Device authentication
* Device heartbeat

## Device provisioning
IoT solutions store data about individual devices such as:

* Device identity and authentication keys
* Device hardware type and version
* Device status
* Software versions and capabilities
* Device command history

The device data that a given IoT solution stores depends on the specific requirements of that solution. But, as a minimum, a solution must store device identities and authentication keys. Azure IoT Hub includes an [identity registry](iot-hub-devguide.md#identityregistry) that can store values for each device such as IDs, authentication keys, and status codes. A solution can use other Azure services such as tables, blobs, or Azure DocumentDB to store any additional device data.

*Device provisioning* is the process of adding the initial device data to the stores in your solution. To enable a new device to connect to your hub, you must add a new device ID and keys to the
[IoT Hub identity registry](iot-hub-devguide.md#identityregistry). As part of the provisioning process, you might need to initialize device-specific data in other solution stores.

The [IoT Hub identity registry APIs](iot-hub-devguide.md#identityregistry) enable you to integrate IoT Hub into your provisioning process.

## Field gateways
In an IoT solution, a *field gateway* sits between your devices and your IoT hub. It is typically located close to your devices. Your devices communicate directly with the field gateway by using a protocol supported by the devices. The field gateway communicates with IoT Hub using a protocol that is supported by IoT Hub. A field gateway can be highly specialized hardware or a low power computer running software that accomplishes the end to end scenario for which the gateway is intended.

A field gateway differs from a simple traffic routing device (such as a network address translation (NAT) device or firewall) because it typically performs an active role in managing access and information flow in your solution. For example, a field gateway may:

* **Add support for new and legacy devices**: There are millions of new and legacy sensors and actuators that cannot send data directly to the cloud. These devices either use a protocol that is not suited for the internet, do not implement encryption, or canâ€™t store identity certificates.  Using a gateway reduces the burden and cost of connecting these devices.
* **Run edge analytics**: There are many operations that can be done locally to reduce the quantity of data exchanged with the cloud. Examples include data filtering, batching, and compression. It may also be desirable to perform some computations such as data cleansing or scoring a machine learning model with real-time data on premise.
* **Minimize latency**: Milliseconds matter when you are trying to prevent manufacturing line shutdowns or restore an electrical service. Analyzing data close to the device that collected the data may make the difference between averting disaster and a cascading system failure.
* **Conserve network bandwidth**: A typical offshore oil platform generates between 1TB and 2TB of data each day. A Boeing 787 creates half a terabyte of data per flight. It is not practical to transport vast amounts of data from thousands or hundreds of thousands of edge devices to the cloud. Nor is it necessary, because many critical analyses do not require cloud-scale processing and storage.
* **Operate reliably**: IoT data is increasingly used for decisions affecting citizen safety and critical infrastructure. The integrity and availability of the infrastructure and data cannot be compromised by intermittent cloud connections. Using capabilities such as store and forward to collect and act upon data locally and then send it up to the cloud when appropriate, help you create reliable solutions.
* **Address privacy and security concerns**: IoT devices, and the data they produce, need to be protected. Gateways can provide services such as isolating devices from the open internet, providing encryption and identity services for devices that are not capable of providing these services themselves, securing data that is locally buffered or stored, and removing personally identifiable information before sending it over the internet.

### Other considerations
You can use the [Azure IoT Gateway SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-gateway-sdk) to implement a field gateway. This SDKs offers specific functionality that such as the ability to multiplex the communication from multiple devices onto the same connection to IoT Hub.

## Custom device authentication
You can use the IoT Hub [device identity registry](iot-hub-devguide.md#identityregistry) to configure per-device security credentials and access control using [tokens](iot-hub-sas-tokens.md). However, if an IoT solution already has a significant investment in a custom device identity registry and/or authentication scheme, you can integrate this existing infrastructure with IoT Hub by creating a *token service*. In this way, you can use other IoT features in your solution.

A token service is a custom cloud service. It uses an IoT Hub *shared access policy* with **DeviceConnect** permissions to create *device-scoped* tokens. These tokens enable a device to connect to your IoT hub.

  ![Steps of the token service pattern](./media/iot-hub-guidance/tokenservice.png)

These are the main steps of the token service pattern:

1. Create an [IoT Hub shared access policy](iot-hub-devguide.md#security) with **DeviceConnect** permissions for your IoT hub. You can create this policy in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) or programmatically. The token service uses this policy to sign the tokens it creates.
2. When a device needs to access your IoT hub, it requests a signed token from your token service. The device can authenticate with your custom device identity registry/authentication scheme to determine the device identity that the token service uses to create the token.
3. The token service returns a token. The token is created as per the [security section of the IoT Hub developer guide](iot-hub-devguide.md#security) by using `/devices/{deviceId}` as `resourceURI`, with `deviceId` as the device being authenticated. The token service uses the shared access policy to construct the token.
4. The device uses the token directly with the IoT hub.

> [!NOTE]
> You can use the .NET class [SharedAccessSignatureBuilder](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.azure.devices.common.security.sharedaccesssignaturebuilder.aspx) or the Java class [IotHubServiceSasToken](http://azure.github.io/azure-iot-sdks/java/service/api_reference/com/microsoft/azure/iot/service/auth/IotHubServiceSasToken.html) to create a token in your token service.

The token service can set the token expiration as desired. When the token expires, the IoT hub severs the device connection. Then, the device must request a new token from the token service. If you use a short expiry time, this increases the load on both the device and the token service.

For a device to connect to your hub, you must still add it to the IoT Hub device identity registry--even though the device is using a token and not a device key to connect. Therefore, you can continue to use per-device access control by enabling or disabling device identities in the [IoT Hub identity registry](iot-hub-devguide.md#identityregistry) when the device authenticates with a token. This mitigates the risks of using tokens with long expiry times.

### Comparison with a custom gateway
The token service pattern is the recommended way to implement a custom identity registry/authentication scheme with IoT Hub. It is recommended because IoT Hub continues to handle most of the solution traffic. However, there are cases where the custom authentication scheme is so intertwined with the protocol that a service processing all the traffic (*custom gateway*) is required. An example of this is [Transport Layer Security (TLS) and pre-shared keys (PSKs)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4279). For more information, see the [protocol gateway](iot-hub-protocol-gateway.md) topic.

## Device heartbeat <a id="heartbeat"></a>
The [IoT Hub identity registry](iot-hub-devguide.md#identityregistry) contains a field called **connectionState**. You should only use the **connectionState** field during development and debugging, IoT solutions should not query the field at run time (for example, to check if a device is connected in order to decide whether to send a cloud-to-device message or an SMS).
If your IoT solution needs to know if a device is connected (either at run time, or with more accuracy than the **connectionState** property provides), your solution should implement the *heartbeat pattern*.

In the heartbeat pattern, the device sends device-to-cloud messages at least once every fixed amount of time (for example, at least once every hour). This means that even if a device does not have any data to send, it still sends an empty device-to-cloud message (usually with a property that identifies it as a heartbeat). On the service side, the solution maintains a map with the last heartbeat received for each device, and assumes that there is a problem with a device if it does not receive a heartbeat message within the expected time.

A more complex implementation could include the information from [operations monitoring](iot-hub-operations-monitoring.md) to identify devices that are trying to connect or communicate but failing. When you implement the heartbeat pattern, make sure to check [IoT Hub Quotas and Throttles](iot-hub-devguide.md#throttling).

> [!NOTE]
> If an IoT solution needs the device connection state solely to determine whether to send cloud-to-device messages, and messages are not broadcast to large sets of devices, a much simpler pattern to consider is to use a short Expiry time. This achieves the same result as maintaining a device connection state registry using the heartbeat pattern, while being significantly more efficient. It is also possible, by requesting message acknowledgements, to be notified by IoT Hub of which devices are able to receive messages and which are not online or are failed. Refer to the [IoT Hub Developer Guide](iot-hub-devguide.md#messaging) for more information on C2D messages.
