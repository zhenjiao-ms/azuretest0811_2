# Tutorial: How to find device twins using queries with C# (preview)
[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-device-management-query-selector](../../includes/iot-hub-device-management-query-selector.md)]

Azure IoT device management enables you to find device twins, the service representation of a physical device, with queries. You can query based on device properties, service properties or tags in the device twin. You can query using tags and properties:

* To query for device twins using tags, you pass an array of strings and the query returns the set of devices which are tagged with all of those strings.
* To query for device twins using service properties or device properties, you use a JSON query expression.

For more information on the device twin and queries, please refer to [Overview of Azure IoT Hub device management](iot-hub-device-management-overview.md).

## Running the device query sample
The following sample extends the [Get started with Azure IoT Hub device management](iot-hub-device-management-get-started.md) tutorial functionality. Starting from having the different simulated devices running, it will use a query to find specific devices.

### Prerequisites
Before running this sample, you must have completed the steps in [Get started with Azure IoT Hub device management](iot-hub-device-management-get-started.md). That means your simulated devices must be running. If you completed the process before, please restart your simulated devices now.

### Starting the sample
To start the sample, you need to run the **Query.exe** process. This will execute a few different queries. Follow the steps below to start the sample:

1. Let the simulated devices run for at least 1 minute. This ensures that the device properties in the twin are synchronized with the physical device. Please see [Tutorial: How to use the device twin](iot-hub-device-management-device-twin.md) for more details on the synchronization.
2. From the root folder where you cloned the **azure-iot-sdks** repository, navigate to the **azure-iot-sdks\\csharp\\service\\samples\\bin** folder.  
3. Run `Query.exe <IoT Hub Connection String>` 

You should see output in the command line window showing the result of queries for device objects using tags, service properties and device properties.

## Query structure (JSON)
Queries on device properties and service properties are executed with a JSON string to represent the query itself. The JSON string is composed 4 parts. Below is an explanation of each part and the C\# object which can  serialized into the correct JSON string.

* **Project**: The expression that designates the fields from the device object to include in the query result set (equivalent to SELECT in SQL):
  
  ```
      var query = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(
          new
          {
              project = new
              {
                  all = false,
                  properties = new[]
                  {
                      new
                      {
                      name = "CustomerId",
                      type = "service"
                      },
                      new
                      {
                      name = "Weight",
                      type = "service"
                      }
                  }
              }
          }
      );
    ```
* **Filter**: The expression that limits the device objects included in the query result set (equivalent to WHERE in SQL):
  
  ```
  var query = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(
      new
      {
        filter = new
        {
          property = new
          {
            name = "CustomerId",
            type = "service"
          },
          value = "123456",
          comparisonOperator = "eq",
          type = "comparison"
        }
      }
  );
  ```
* **Aggregate**: The expression that determines how to group the query result set (equivalent to GROUPBY in SQL):
  
  ```
  var query = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(
      new
      {
      filter = new
        {
          property = new
          {
            name = "CustomerId",
            type = "service"
          },
          value = (string)null,
          comparisonOperator = "ne",
          type = "comparison"
        },
        aggregate = new
        {
          keys = new[]
          {
            new
            {
              name = "CustomerId",
              type = "service"
            }
          },
          properties = new[]
          {
            new
            {
              @operator = "avg",
              property = new
              {
                name = "Weight",
                type = "service"
              },
              columnName = "TotalWeight"
            }
          }
        }
      }
  );
  ```
* **Sort**: The expression definition which property should be used to sort the query result set (equivalent to ORDER BY in SQL). If sort is null, **deviceID** is used by default:
  
  ```
  var query = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(
    new
    {
      sort = new[]
      {
        new
        {
          property = new
          {
            name = "QoS",
            type = "service"
          },
          order = "asc"
        }
      }
    }
  );
  ```

### Limitations
There are some limitations in the public preview implementation of queries.

* There is no validation on the query expression.
* Queries are case sensitive.
* Only 100 devices will be returned when using query expressions to query by service or device properties. An example of how to implement paging is available in [our query library](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks/blob/dmpreview/doc/get_started/dm_queries/query-samples.md).

More details on the syntax and available fields for the JSON are [available](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks/blob/dmpreview/node/service/devdoc/query_expression_requirements.md). You can also see sample queries in our [query expressions library](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks/blob/dmpreview/doc/get_started/dm_queries/query-samples.md).

### Query by device and service properties
Once you have the JSON query expression, you can query for the device twins. Call **QueryDeviceJsonAsync** and check the **AggregateResult** field for aggregate queries and the **Result** field for all other queries. **Result** contains a list of device objects, which represent the device twins that match the query. **AggregateResult** contains an array of dictionaries, each containing the resulting row.

These queries are used in **Program.cs** of the **Query** project.

```
var foundDevices = (await registryManager.QueryDevicesJsonAsync(query)).Result;

var results = (await registryManager.QueryDevicesJsonAsync(query)).AggregateResult;
```

### Query by tags
Querying by tags enables you to find device objects without using a JSON query expression. If more than one tag is passed, only device objects with all the tags will be returned. The second parameter is **maxCount**, the maximum number of devices to be returned. The maximum value for **maxCount** is 1000.

```
var foundDevices = await registryManager.QueryDevicesAsync(new[] { "bacon" }, 100);
```

### Device Implementation
The query is enabled by the Azure IoT Hub device management client library. As long as your device properties are synchronized (as described in [Tutorial: How to use the device twin](iot-hub-device-management-device-twin.md)), you can query on them. Device properties are available only after the physical device connects to IoT Hub and provides initial values.
