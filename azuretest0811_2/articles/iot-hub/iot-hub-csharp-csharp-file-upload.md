# Tutorial: How to upload files from devices to the cloud with IoT Hub
## Introduction
Azure IoT Hub is a fully managed service that enables reliable and secure bi-directional communications between millions of IoT devices and an application back end. Previous tutorials ([Get started with IoT Hub](iot-hub-csharp-csharp-getstarted.md) and [Send Cloud-to-Device messages with IoT Hub](iot-hub-csharp-csharp-c2d.md)) illustrate the basic device-to-cloud and cloud-to-device messaging functionality of IoT Hub, and the [Process Device-to-Cloud messages](iot-hub-csharp-csharp-process-d2c.md) tutorial describes a way to reliably store device-to-cloud messages in Azure blob storage. However, in some scenarios you cannot easily map the data your devices send into the relatively small device-to-cloud messages that IoT Hub accepts. Examples include large files that contain images, videos, vibration data sampled at high frequency, or that contain some form of preprocessed data. These files are typically batch processed in the cloud using tools such as [Azure Data Factory](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/services/data-factory/) or the [Hadoop](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/services/hdinsight/) stack. When file uploads from a device are preferred to sending events, you can still use IoT Hub security and reliability functionality.

This tutorial builds on the code in the [Send Cloud-to-Device messages with IoT Hub](iot-hub-csharp-csharp-c2d.md) tutorial to show you how to use the file upload capabilities of IoT Hub. It shows you how to securely provide a device with an Azure blob URI for uploading a file, and how to use the IoT Hub file upload notifications to trigger processing the file in your app back end.

At the end of this tutorial you run two Windows console applications:

* **SimulatedDevice**, a modified version of the app created in the [Send Cloud-to-Device messages with IoT Hub](iot-hub-csharp-csharp-c2d.md) tutorial, which uploads a file to storage using a SAS URI provided by your IoT hub.
* **ReadFileUploadNotification**, which receives file upload notifications from your IoT hub.

> [!NOTE]
> IoT Hub supports many device platforms and languages (including C, Java, and Javascript) through Azure IoT device SDKs. Refer to the [Azure IoT Developer Center](http://www.azure.com/develop/iot) for step by step instructions on how to connect your device to the code shown in this tutorial, and generally to Azure IoT Hub.

In order to complete this tutorial you need the following:

* Microsoft Visual Studio 2015,
* An active Azure account. (If you don't have an account, you can create a free trial account in just a couple of minutes. For details, see [Azure Free Trial](http://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).)

## Associate an Azure Storage account to IoT Hub
Because the simulated device uploads a file to an Azure Storage blob, you must have an [Azure Storage](../storage/storage-create-storage-account.md#create-a-storage-account) account associated to IoT Hub. When you associate a storage account with an IoT hub, the hub can generate a SAS URI that a device can use to securely upload a file to a blob container. The IoT Hub service and the device SDKs coordinate the process that generates the SAS URI and makes it available to a device to use to upload a file.

Follow the instructions in [Manage IoT hubs through the Azure portal](iot-hub-manage-through-portal.md#file-upload) to associate an Azure Storage account to your IoT hub.

## Upload a file from a simulated device
In this section, you modify the simulated device application you created in [Send Cloud-to-Device messages with IoT Hub](iot-hub-csharp-csharp-c2d.md) to receive cloud-to-device messages from the IoT hub.

1. In Visual Studio, right-click the **SimulatedDevice** project, click **Add**, and then click **Existing Item**. Navigate to an image file and include it in your project. This tutorial assumes the image is named `image.jpg`.
2. Right-click on the image, and then click **Properties**. Make sure that **Copy to Output Directory** is set to **Copy always**.
   
    ![](./media/iot-hub-csharp-csharp-file-upload/image-properties.png)
3. In the **Program.cs** file, add the following statements at the top of the file:
   
        using System.IO;
4. Add the following method to the **Program** class:
   
        private static async void SendToBlobAsync()
        {
            string fileName = "image.jpg";
            Console.WriteLine("Uploading file: {0}", fileName);
            var watch = System.Diagnostics.Stopwatch.StartNew();
   
            using (var sourceData = new FileStream(@"image.jpg", FileMode.Open))
            {
                await deviceClient.UploadToBlobAsync(fileName, sourceData);
            }
   
            watch.Stop();
            Console.WriteLine("Time to upload file: {0}ms\n", watch.ElapsedMilliseconds);
        }
   
    The `UploadToBlobAsync` method takes in the file name and stream source of the file to be uploaded and handles the upload to storage. The console application displays the time it takes to upload the file.
5. Add the following method in the **Main** method, right before the `Console.ReadLine()` line:
   
        SendToBlobAsync();

> [!NOTE]
> For simplicity's sake, this tutorial does not implement any retry policy. In production code, you should implement retry policies (such as exponential backoff), as suggested in the MSDN article [Transient Fault Handling](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh680901\(v=pandp.50\).aspx).

## Receive a file upload notification
In this section, you write a Windows console app that receives file upload notification messages from IoT Hub.

1. In the current Visual Studio solution, create a new Visual C# Windows project by using the **Console Application** project template. Name the project **ReadFileUploadNotification**.
   
    ![New project in Visual Studio](./media/iot-hub-csharp-csharp-file-upload/create-identity-csharp1.png)
2. In Solution Explorer, right-click the **ReadFileUploadNotification** project, and then click **Manage NuGet Packages**.
   
    This displays the Manage NuGet Packages window.
3. Search for `Microsoft.Azure.Devices`, click **Install**, and accept the terms of use. 
   
    This downloads, installs, and adds a reference to the [Azure IoT - Service SDK NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Devices/) in the **ReadFileUploadNotification** project.
4. In the **Program.cs** file, add the following statements at the top of the file:
   
        using Microsoft.Azure.Devices;
5. Add the following fields to the **Program** class. Substitute the placeholder value with the IoT hub connection string from [Get started with IoT Hub](iot-hub-csharp-csharp-getstarted.md):
   
        static ServiceClient serviceClient;
        static string connectionString = "{iot hub connection string}";
6. Add the following method to the **Program** class:
   
        private async static Task ReceiveFileUploadNotificationAsync()
        {
            var notificationReceiver = serviceClient.GetFileNotificationReceiver();
   
            Console.WriteLine("\nReceiving file upload notification from service");
            while (true)
            {
                var fileUploadNotification = await notificationReceiver.ReceiveAsync();
                if (fileUploadNotification == null) continue;
   
                Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.Yellow;
                Console.WriteLine("Received file upload noticiation: {0}", string.Join(", ", fileUploadNotification.BlobName));
                Console.ResetColor();
   
                await notificationReceiver.CompleteAsync(fileUploadNotification);
            }
        }
   
    Note that the receive pattern is the same one used to receive cloud-to-device messages from the device app.
7. Finally, add the following lines to the **Main** method:
   
        Console.WriteLine("Receive file upload notifications\n");
        serviceClient = ServiceClient.CreateFromConnectionString(connectionString);
        ReceiveFileUploadNotificationAsync().Wait();
        Console.ReadLine();

## Run the applications
Now you are ready to run the applications.

1. In Visual Studio, right-click your solution, and select **Set StartUp projects**. Select **Multiple startup projects**, then select the **Start** action for **ReadFileUploadNotification** and **SimulatedDevice**.
2. Press **F5**. Both applications should start. You should see the upload completed in one console app and the upload notification message being received by the other console app. You can use the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) or Visual Studio Server Explorer to check for the presence of the uploaded file in your storage account.
