# Create an IoT hub using PowerShell
[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-resource-manager-selector](../../includes/iot-hub-resource-manager-selector.md)]

## Introduction
You can use Azure Resource Manager (ARM) to create and manage Azure IoT hubs programmatically. This tutorial shows you how to use a resource manager template to create an IoT hub with PowerShell.

> [!NOTE]
> Azure has two different deployment models for creating and working with resources:  [Resource Manager and classic](../resource-manager-deployment-model.md).  This article covers using the Resource Manager deployment model.
> 
> 

In order to complete this tutorial you'll need the following:

* An active Azure account. <br/>If you don't have an account, you can create a free trial account in just a couple of minutes. For details, see [Azure Free Trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).
* [Microsoft Azure PowerShell 1.0](../powershell-install-configure.md) or later.

> [!TIP]
> The article [Using Azure PowerShell with Azure Resource Manager](../powershell-azure-resource-manager.md) provides more information about how to use PowerShell scripts and ARM templates to create Azure resources. 
> 
> 

## Connect to your Azure subscription
In a PowerShell command prompt, enter the following command to sign in to your Azure subscription:

```
Login-AzureRmAccount
```

You can use the following commands to discover where you can deploy an IoT hub and the currently supported API versions:

```
((Get-AzureRmResourceProvider -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.Devices).ResourceTypes | Where-Object ResourceTypeName -eq IoTHubs).Locations
((Get-AzureRmResourceProvider -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.Devices).ResourceTypes | Where-Object ResourceTypeName -eq IoTHubs).ApiVersions
```

Create a resource group to contain your IoT hub using the following command in one of the supported locations for IoT Hub. This example creates a resource group called **MyIoTRG1**:

```
New-AzureRmResourceGroup -Name MyIoTRG1 -Location "East US"
```

## Submit a template to create an IoT hub
Use a JSON template to create a new IoT hub in your resource group. You can also use a template to make changes to an existing IoT hub.

1. Use a text editor to create an ARM template called **template.json** with the following resource definition to create a new standard IoT hub. This example adds the IoT Hub in the **East US** region, creates two consumer groups (**cg1** and **cg2**) on the Event Hub-compatible endpoint, and uses the **2016-02-03** API version. This template also expects you to pass in the IoT hub name as a parameter called **hubName**.
   
    ```
    {
      "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2015-01-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
      "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
      "parameters": {
        "hubName": {
          "type": "string"
        }
      },
      "resources": [
      {
        "apiVersion": "2016-02-03",
        "type": "Microsoft.Devices/IotHubs",
        "name": "[parameters('hubName')]",
        "location": "East US",
        "sku": {
          "name": "S1",
          "tier": "Standard",
          "capacity": 1
        },
        "properties": {
          "location": "East US"
        }
      },
      {
        "apiVersion": "2016-02-03",
        "type": "Microsoft.Devices/IotHubs/eventhubEndpoints/ConsumerGroups",
        "name": "[concat(parameters('hubName'), '/events/cg1')]",
        "dependsOn": [
          "[concat('Microsoft.Devices/Iothubs/', parameters('hubName'))]"
        ]
      },
      {
        "apiVersion": "2016-02-03",
        "type": "Microsoft.Devices/IotHubs/eventhubEndpoints/ConsumerGroups",
        "name": "[concat(parameters('hubName'), '/events/cg2')]",
        "dependsOn": [
          "[concat('Microsoft.Devices/Iothubs/', parameters('hubName'))]"
        ]
      }
      ],
      "outputs": {
        "hubKeys": {
          "value": "[listKeys(resourceId('Microsoft.Devices/IotHubs', parameters('hubName')), '2016-02-03')]",
          "type": "object"
        }
      }
    }
    ```
2. Save the template file on your local machine. This example assumes you save it in a folder called **c:\templates**.
3. Run the following command to deploy your new IoT hub, passing the name of your IoT hub as a parameter. In this example, the name of the IoT hub is **abcmyiothub** (note that this name must be globally unique so it should include your name or initials):
   
    ```
    New-AzureRmResourceGroupDeployment -ResourceGroupName MyIoTRG1 -TemplateFile C:\templates\template.json -hubName abcmyiothub
    ```
4. The output displays the keys for the IoT hub you created.
5. You can verify that your application added the new IoT hub by visiting the [portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and viewing your list of resources, or by using the **Get-AzureRmResource** PowerShell cmdlet.

> [!NOTE]
> This example application adds an S1 Standard IoT Hub for which you will be billed. You can delete the IoT hub through the [portal](https://portal.azure.com/) or by using the **Remove-AzureRmResource** PowerShell cmdlet when you are finished.

## Next steps
Now you have deployed an IoT hub using an ARM template with PowerShell, you may want to explore further:

* Read about the capabilities of the [IoT Hub Resource Provider REST API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt589014.aspx).
* Read [Azure Resource Manager overview](../resource-group-overview.md) to learn more about the capabilities of Azure Resource Manager.

To learn more about developing for IoT Hub, see the following:
