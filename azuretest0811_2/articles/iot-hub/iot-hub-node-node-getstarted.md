# Get started with Azure IoT Hub for Node.js
[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-selector-get-started](../../includes/iot-hub-selector-get-started.md)]

At the end of this tutorial, you will have three Node.js console applications:

* **CreateDeviceIdentity.js**, which creates a device identity and associated security key to connect your simulated device.
* **ReadDeviceToCloudMessages.js**, which displays the telemetry sent by your simulated device.
* **SimulatedDevice.js**, which connects to your IoT hub with the device identity created earlier, and sends a telemetry message every second using the AMQPS protocol.

> [!NOTE]
> The article [IoT Hub SDKs](iot-hub-sdks-summary.md) provides information about the various SDKs that you can use to build both applications to run on devices and your solution back end.
> 
> 

To complete this tutorial you'll need the following:

* Node.js version 0.12.x or later. <br/> [Prepare your development environment](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks/blob/master/doc/get_started/node-devbox-setup.md) describes how to install Node.js for this tutorial on either Windows or Linux.
* An active Azure account. (If you don't have an account, you can create a free trial account in just a couple of minutes. For details, see [Azure Free Trial](http://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).)

[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-get-started-create-hub](../../includes/iot-hub-get-started-create-hub.md)]

You have now created your IoT hub. You have the IoT Hub hostname and the IoT Hub connection string that you need to complete the rest of this tutorial.

## Create a device identity
In this section, you'll create a Node.js console app that creates a new device identity in the identity registry in your IoT hub. A device cannot connect to IoT hub unless it has an entry in the device identity registry. Refer to the **Device Identity Registry** section of the [IoT Hub Developer Guide](iot-hub-devguide.md#identityregistry) for more information. When you run this console application, it generates a unique device ID and key that your device can use to identify itself when it sends device-to-cloud messages to IoT Hub.

1. Create a new empty folder called **createdeviceidentity**. In the **createdeviceidentity** folder, create a new package.json file using the following command at your command-prompt. Accept all the defaults:
   
    ```
    npm init
    ```
2. At your command-prompt in the **createdeviceidentity** folder, run the following command to install the **azure-iothub** package:
   
    ```
    npm install azure-iothub --save
    ```
3. Using a text editor, create a new **CreateDeviceIdentity.js** file in the **createdeviceidentity** folder.
4. Add the following `require` statement at the start of the **CreateDeviceIdentity.js** file:
   
    ```
    'use strict';
   
    var iothub = require('azure-iothub');
    ```
5. Add the following code to the **CreateDeviceIdentity.js** file and replace the placeholder value with the connection string for the IoT hub you created in the previous section: 
   
    ```
    var connectionString = '{iothub connection string}';
   
    var registry = iothub.Registry.fromConnectionString(connectionString);
    ```
6. Add the following code to create a new device definition in the device identity registry in your IoT hub. This code creates a new device if the device id does not exist in the registry, otherwise it returns the key of the existing device:
   
    ```
    var device = new iothub.Device(null);
    device.deviceId = 'myFirstNodeDevice';
    registry.create(device, function(err, deviceInfo, res) {
      if (err) {
        registry.get(device.deviceId, printDeviceInfo);
      }
      if (deviceInfo) {
        printDeviceInfo(err, deviceInfo, res)
      }
    });
   
    function printDeviceInfo(err, deviceInfo, res) {
      if (deviceInfo) {
        console.log('Device id: ' + deviceInfo.deviceId);
        console.log('Device key: ' + deviceInfo.authentication.SymmetricKey.primaryKey);
      }
    }
    ```
7. Save and close **CreateDeviceIdentity.js** file.
8. To run the **createdeviceidentity** application, execute the following command at the command-prompt in the createdeviceidentity folder:
   
    ```
    node CreateDeviceIdentity.js 
    ```
9. Make a note of the **Device id** and **Device key**. You will need these later when you create an application that connects to IoT Hub as a device.

> [!NOTE]
> The IoT Hub identity registry only stores device identities to enable secure access to the hub. It stores device IDs and keys to use as security credentials and an enabled/disabled flag that you can use to disable access for an individual device. If your application needs to store other device-specific metadata, it should use an application-specific store. Refer to [IoT Hub Developer Guide](iot-hub-devguide.md#identityregistry) for more information.

## Receive device-to-cloud messages
In this section, you'll create a Node.js console app that reads device-to-cloud messages from IoT Hub. An IoT hub exposes an [Event Hubs](../event-hubs/event-hubs-overview.md)-compatible endpoint to enable you to read device-to-cloud messages. To keep things simple, this tutorial creates a basic reader that is not suitable for a high throughput deployment. The [Process device-to-cloud messages](iot-hub-csharp-csharp-process-d2c.md) tutorial shows you how to process device-to-cloud messages at scale. The [Get Started with Event Hubs](../event-hubs/event-hubs-csharp-ephcs-getstarted.md) tutorial provides further information on how to process messages from Event Hubs and is applicable to the IoT Hub Event Hubs-compatible endpoints.

> [!NOTE]
> The Event Hubs-compatible endpoint for reading device-to-cloud messages always uses the AMQPS protocol.
> 
> 

1. Create a new empty folder called **readdevicetocloudmessages**. In the **readdevicetocloudmessages** folder, create a new package.json file using the following command at your command-prompt. Accept all the defaults:
   
    ```
    npm init
    ```
2. At your command-prompt in the **readdevicetocloudmessages** folder, run the following command to install the **azure-event-hubs** package:
   
    ```
    npm install azure-event-hubs --save
    ```
3. Using a text editor, create a new **ReadDeviceToCloudMessages.js** file in the **readdevicetocloudmessages** folder.
4. Add the following `require` statements at the start of the **ReadDeviceToCloudMessages.js** file:
   
    ```
    'use strict';
   
    var EventHubClient = require('azure-event-hubs').Client;
    ```
5. Add the following variable declaration and replace the placeholder value with the connection string for your IoT hub:
   
    ```
    var connectionString = '{iothub connection string}';
    ```
6. Add the following two functions that print output to the console:
   
    ```
    var printError = function (err) {
      console.log(err.message);
    };
   
    var printMessage = function (message) {
      console.log('Message received: ');
      console.log(JSON.stringify(message.body));
      console.log('');
    };
    ```
7. Add the following code to create the **EventHubClient**, open the connection to your IoT Hub, and create a receiver for each partition. This application uses a filter when it creates a receiver so that the receiver only reads messages sent to IoT Hub after the receiver starts running. This is useful in a test environment so you see just the current set of messages, but in a production environment your code should make sure that it processes all the messages - see the [How to process IoT Hub device-to-cloud messages](iot-hub-csharp-csharp-process-d2c.md) tutorial for more information:
   
    ```
    var client = EventHubClient.fromConnectionString(connectionString);
    client.open()
        .then(client.getPartitionIds.bind(client))
        .then(function (partitionIds) {
            return partitionIds.map(function (partitionId) {
                return client.createReceiver('$Default', partitionId, { 'startAfterTime' : Date.now()}).then(function(receiver) {
                    console.log('Created partition receiver: ' + partitionId)
                    receiver.on('errorReceived', printError);
                    receiver.on('message', printMessage);
                });
            });
        })
        .catch(printError);
    ```
8. Save and close the **ReadDeviceToCloudMessages.js** file.

## Create a simulated device app
In this section, you'll create a Node.js console app that simulates a device that sends device-to-cloud messages to an IoT hub.

1. Create a new empty folder called **simulateddevice**. In the **simulateddevice** folder, create a new package.json file using the following command at your command-prompt. Accept all the defaults:
   
    ```
    npm init
    ```
2. At your command-prompt in the **simulateddevice** folder, run the following command to install the **azure-iot-device-amqp** package:
   
    ```
    npm install azure-iot-device azure-iot-device-amqp --save
    ```
3. Using a text editor, create a new **SimulatedDevice.js** file in the **simulateddevice** folder.
4. Add the following `require` statements at the start of the **SimulatedDevice.js** file:
   
    ```
    'use strict';
   
    var clientFromConnectionString = require('azure-iot-device-amqp').clientFromConnectionString;
    var Message = require('azure-iot-device').Message;
    ```
5. Add a **connectionString** variable and use it to create a device client. Replace **{youriothostname}** with the name of the IoT hub you created the *Create an IoT Hub* section and **{yourdevicekey}** with the device key value you generated in the *Create a device identity* section:
   
    ```
    var connectionString = 'HostName={youriothostname};DeviceId=myFirstNodeDevice;SharedAccessKey={yourdevicekey}';
   
    var client = clientFromConnectionString(connectionString);
    ```
6. Add the following function to display output from the application:
   
    ```
    function printResultFor(op) {
      return function printResult(err, res) {
        if (err) console.log(op + ' error: ' + err.toString());
        if (res) console.log(op + ' status: ' + res.constructor.name);
      };
    }
    ```
7. Create a callback and use the **setInterval** function to send a new message to your IoT hub every second:
   
    ```
    var connectCallback = function (err) {
      if (err) {
        console.log('Could not connect: ' + err);
      } else {
        console.log('Client connected');
   
        // Create a message and send it to the IoT Hub every second
        setInterval(function(){
            var windSpeed = 10 + (Math.random() * 4);
            var data = JSON.stringify({ deviceId: 'myFirstNodeDevice', windSpeed: windSpeed });
            var message = new Message(data);
            console.log("Sending message: " + message.getData());
            client.sendEvent(message, printResultFor('send'));
        }, 1000);
      }
    };
    ```
8. Open the connection to your IoT Hub and start sending messages:
   
    ```
    client.open(connectCallback);
    ```
9. Save and close the **SimulatedDevice.js** file.

> [!NOTE]
> To keep things simple, this tutorial does not implement any retry policy. In production code, you should implement retry policies (such as an exponential backoff), as suggested in the MSDN article [Transient Fault Handling](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh680901\(v=pandp.50\).aspx).

## Run the applications
You are now ready to run the applications.

1. At a command-prompt in the **readdevicetocloudmessages** folder, run the following command to begin monitoring your IoT hub:
   
    ```
    node ReadDeviceToCloudMessages.js 
    ```
   
    ![](./media/iot-hub-node-node-getstarted/runapp1.png)
2. At a command-prompt in the **simulateddevice** folder, run the following command to begin sending telemetry data to your IoT hub:
   
    ```
    node SimulatedDevice.js
    ```
   
    ![](./media/iot-hub-node-node-getstarted/runapp2.png)
3. The **Usage** tile in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) shows the number of messages sent to the hub:
   
    ![](./media/iot-hub-csharp-csharp-getstarted/usage.png)

## Next steps
In this tutorial, you configured a new IoT hub in the portal, and then created a device identity in the hub's identity registry. You used this device identity to enable the simulated device app to send device-to-cloud messages to the hub. You also created an app that displays the messages received by the hub.
