# Get started with Azure IoT Hub for Java
[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-selector-get-started](../../includes/iot-hub-selector-get-started.md)]

At the end of this tutorial, you will have three Java console applications:

* **create-device-identity**, which creates a device identity and associated security key to connect your simulated device.
* **read-d2c-messages**, which displays the telemetry sent by your simulated device.
* **simulated-device**, which connects to your IoT hub with the device identity created earlier, and sends a telemetry message every second using the AMQPS protocol.

> [!NOTE]
> The article [IoT Hub SDKs](iot-hub-sdks-summary.md) provides information about the various SDKs that you can use to build both applications to run on devices and your solution back end.
> 
> 

To complete this tutorial you'll need the following:

* Java SE 8. <br/> [Prepare your development environment](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks/blob/master/doc/get_started/java-devbox-setup.md) describes how to install Java for this tutorial on either Windows or Linux.
* Maven 3.  <br/> [Prepare your development environment](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks/blob/master/doc/get_started/java-devbox-setup.md) describes how to install Maven for this tutorial on either Windows or Linux.
* An active Azure account. (If you don't have an account, you can create a free trial account in just a couple of minutes. For details, see [Azure Free Trial](http://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).)

[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-get-started-create-hub](../../includes/iot-hub-get-started-create-hub.md)]

As a final step, make a note of the **Primary key** value, then click **Settings** on the IoT Hub blade, then **Messaging** on the **Settings** blade. On the **Messaging** blade, make a note of the **Event Hub-compatible name** and the **Event Hub-compatible endpoint**. You will need these three values when you create your **read-d2c-messages** application.

![](./media/iot-hub-java-java-getstarted/create-iot-hub6.png)

You have now created your IoT hub, and you have the IoT Hub hostname, IoT Hub connection string, IoT Hub Primary Key, Event Hubs-compatible name, and Event Hubs-compatible endpoint you need to complete the rest of this tutorial.

## Create a device identity
In this section, you'll create a Java console app that creates a new device identity in the identity registry in your IoT hub. A device cannot connect to IoT hub unless it has an entry in the device identity registry. Refer to the **Device Identity Registry** section of the [IoT Hub Developer Guide](iot-hub-devguide.md#identityregistry) for more information. When you run this console application, it generates a unique device ID and key that your device can use to identify itself when it sends device-to-cloud messages to IoT Hub.

1. Create a new empty folder called iot-java-get-started. In the iot-java-get-started folder, create a new Maven project called **create-device-identity** using the following command at your command-prompt. Note that this is a single, long command:
   
    ```
    mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.mycompany.app -DartifactId=create-device-identity -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DinteractiveMode=false
    ```
2. At your command prompt, navigate to the new create-device-identity folder.
3. Using a text editor, open the pom.xml file in the create-device-identity folder and add the following dependency to the **dependencies** node. This enables you to use the iothub-service-sdk package in your application:
   
    ```
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.microsoft.azure.iothub-java-client</groupId>
      <artifactId>iothub-java-service-client</artifactId>
      <version>1.0.7</version>
    </dependency>
    ```
4. Save and close the pom.xml file.
5. Using a text editor, open the create-device-identity\src\main\java\com\mycompany\app\App.java file.
6. Add the following **import** statements to the file:
   
    ```
    import com.microsoft.azure.iot.service.exceptions.IotHubException;
    import com.microsoft.azure.iot.service.sdk.Device;
    import com.microsoft.azure.iot.service.sdk.RegistryManager;
   
    import java.io.IOException;
    import java.net.URISyntaxException;
    ```
7. Add the following class-level variables to the **App** class, replacing **{yourhubconnectionstring}** with the value your noted earlier:
   
    ```
    private static final String connectionString = "{yourhubconnectionstring}";
    private static final String deviceId = "myFirstJavaDevice";
   
    ```
8. Modify the signature of the **main** method to include the exceptions shown below:
   
    ```
    public static void main( String[] args ) throws IOException, URISyntaxException, Exception
    ```
9. Add the following code as the body of the **main** method. This code creates a device called *javadevice* in your IoT Hub identity registry if doesn't already exist. It then displays the device id and key that you will need later:
   
    ```
    RegistryManager registryManager = RegistryManager.createFromConnectionString(connectionString);
   
    Device device = Device.createFromId(deviceId, null, null);
    try {
      device = registryManager.addDevice(device);
    } catch (IotHubException iote) {
      try {
        device = registryManager.getDevice(deviceId);
      } catch (IotHubException iotf) {
        iotf.printStackTrace();
      }
    }
    System.out.println("Device id: " + device.getDeviceId());
    System.out.println("Device key: " + device.getPrimaryKey());
    ```
10. Save and close the App.java file.
11. To build the **create-device-identity** application using Maven, execute the following command at the command-prompt in the create-device-identity folder:
    
    ```
    mvn clean package -DskipTests
    ```
12. To run the **create-device-identity** application using Maven, execute the following command at the command-prompt in the create-device-identity folder:
    
    ```
    mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.mycompany.app.App"
    ```
13. Make a note of the **Device id** and **Device key**. You will need these later when you create an application that connects to IoT Hub as a device.

> [!NOTE]
> The IoT Hub identity registry only stores device identities to enable secure access to the hub. It stores device IDs and keys to use as security credentials and an enabled/disabled flag that you can use to disable access for an individual device. If your application needs to store other device-specific metadata, it should use an application-specific store. Refer to [IoT Hub Developer Guide](iot-hub-devguide.md#identityregistry) for more information.

## Receive device-to-cloud messages
In this section, you'll create a Java console app that reads device-to-cloud messages from IoT Hub. An IoT hub exposes an [Event Hub](../event-hubs/event-hubs-overview.md)-compatible endpoint to enable you to read device-to-cloud messages. To keep things simple, this tutorial creates a basic reader that is not suitable for a high throughput deployment. The [Process device-to-cloud messages](iot-hub-csharp-csharp-process-d2c.md) tutorial shows you how to process device-to-cloud messages at scale. The [Get Started with Event Hubs](../event-hubs/event-hubs-csharp-ephcs-getstarted.md) tutorial provides further information on how to process messages from Event Hubs and is applicable to the IoT Hub Event Hubs-compatible endpoints.

> [!NOTE]
> The Event Hubs-compatible endpoint for reading device-to-cloud messages always uses the AMQPS protocol.
> 
> 

1. In the iot-java-get-started folder you created in the *Create a device identity* section, create a new Maven project called **read-d2c-messages** using the following command at your command-prompt. Note that this is a single, long command:
   
    ```
    mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.mycompany.app -DartifactId=read-d2c-messages -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DinteractiveMode=false
    ```
2. At your command prompt, navigate to the new read-d2c-messages folder.
3. Using a text editor, open the pom.xml file in the read-d2c-messages folder and add the following dependency to the **dependencies** node. This enables you to use the eventhubs-client package in your application to read from the Event Hubs-compatible endpoint:
   
    ```
    <dependency> 
        <groupId>com.microsoft.azure</groupId> 
        <artifactId>azure-eventhubs</artifactId> 
        <version>0.7.1</version> 
    </dependency>
    ```
4. Save and close the pom.xml file.
5. Using a text editor, open the read-d2c-messages\src\main\java\com\mycompany\app\App.java file.
6. Add the following **import** statements to the file:
   
    ```
    import java.io.IOException;
    import com.microsoft.azure.eventhubs.*;
    import com.microsoft.azure.servicebus.*;
   
    import java.io.IOException;
    import java.nio.charset.Charset;
    import java.time.*;
    import java.util.Collection;
    import java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException;
    import java.util.function.*;
    import java.util.logging.*;
    ```
7. Add the following class-level variables to the **App** class. Replace **{youriothubkey}**, **{youreventhubcompatibleendpoint}**, and **{youreventhubcompatiblename}** with the values you noted previously:
   
    ```
    private static String connStr = "Endpoint={youreventhubcompatibleendpoint};EntityPath={youreventhubcompatiblename};SharedAccessKeyName=iothubowner;SharedAccessKey={youriothubkey}";
    ```
8. Add the following **receiveMessages** method to the **App** class. This method creates an **EventHubClient** instance to connect to the Event Hubs-compatible endpoint and then asynchronously creates a **PartitionReceiver** instance to read from an Event Hub partition. It loops continuously and prints the message details until the application terminates.
   
    ```
    private static EventHubClient receiveMessages(final String partitionId)
    {
      EventHubClient client = null;
      try {
        client = EventHubClient.createFromConnectionStringSync(connStr);
      }
      catch(Exception e) {
        System.out.println("Failed to create client: " + e.getMessage());
        System.exit(1);
      }
      try {
        client.createReceiver( 
          EventHubClient.DEFAULT_CONSUMER_GROUP_NAME,  
          partitionId,  
          Instant.now()).thenAccept(new Consumer<PartitionReceiver>()
        {
          public void accept(PartitionReceiver receiver)
          {
            System.out.println("** Created receiver on partition " + partitionId);
            try {
              while (true) {
                Iterable<EventData> receivedEvents = receiver.receive(100).get();
                int batchSize = 0;
                if (receivedEvents != null)
                {
                  for(EventData receivedEvent: receivedEvents)
                  {
                    System.out.println(String.format("Offset: %s, SeqNo: %s, EnqueueTime: %s", 
                      receivedEvent.getSystemProperties().getOffset(), 
                      receivedEvent.getSystemProperties().getSequenceNumber(), 
                      receivedEvent.getSystemProperties().getEnqueuedTime()));
                    System.out.println(String.format("| Device ID: %s", receivedEvent.getProperties().get("iothub-connection-device-id")));
                    System.out.println(String.format("| Message Payload: %s", new String(receivedEvent.getBody(),
                      Charset.defaultCharset())));
                    batchSize++;
                  }
                }
                System.out.println(String.format("Partition: %s, ReceivedBatch Size: %s", partitionId,batchSize));
              }
            }
            catch (Exception e)
            {
              System.out.println("Failed to receive messages: " + e.getMessage());
            }
          }
        });
      }
      catch (Exception e)
      {
        System.out.println("Failed to create receiver: " + e.getMessage());
      }
      return client;
    }
    ```
   
   > [!NOTE]
   > This method uses a filter when it creates the receiver so that the receiver only reads messages sent to IoT Hub after the receiver starts running. This is useful in a test environment so you can see the current set of messages, but in a production environment your code should make sure that it processes all the messages - see the [How to process IoT Hub device-to-cloud messages][lnk-process-d2c-tutorial] tutorial for more information.
   > 
9. Modify the signature of the **main** method to include the exception shown below:
   
    ```
    public static void main( String[] args ) throws IOException
    ```
10. Add the following code to the **main** method in the **App** class. This code creates the two **EventHubClient** and **PartitionReceiver** instances and enables you to close the application when you have finished processing messages:
    
    ```
    EventHubClient client0 = receiveMessages("0");
    EventHubClient client1 = receiveMessages("1");
    System.out.println("Press ENTER to exit.");
    System.in.read();
    try
    {
      client0.closeSync();
      client1.closeSync();
      System.exit(0);
    }
    catch (ServiceBusException sbe)
    {
      System.exit(1);
    }
    ```
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > This code assumes you created your IoT hub in the F1 (free) tier. A free IoT hub has two partitions named "0" and "1".
    > 
11. Save and close the App.java file.
12. To build the **read-d2c-messages** application using Maven, execute the following command at the command-prompt in the read-d2c-messages folder:
    
    ```
    mvn clean package -DskipTests
    ```

## Create a simulated device app
In this section, you'll create a Java console app that simulates a device that sends device-to-cloud messages to an IoT hub.

1. In the iot-java-get-started folder you created in the *Create a device identity* section, create a new Maven project called **simulated-device** using the following command at your command-prompt. Note that this is a single, long command:
   
    ```
    mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.mycompany.app -DartifactId=simulated-device -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DinteractiveMode=false
    ```
2. At your command prompt, navigate to the new simulated-device folder.
3. Using a text editor, open the pom.xml file in the simulated-device folder and add the following dependencies to the **dependencies** node. This enables you to use the iothub-java-client package in your application to communicate with your IoT hub and to serialize Java objects to JSON:
   
    ```
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.microsoft.azure.iothub-java-client</groupId>
      <artifactId>iothub-java-device-client</artifactId>
      <version>1.0.8</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.google.code.gson</groupId>
      <artifactId>gson</artifactId>
      <version>2.3.1</version>
    </dependency>
    ```
4. Save and close the pom.xml file.
5. Using a text editor, open the simulated-device\src\main\java\com\mycompany\app\App.java file.
6. Add the following **import** statements to the file:
   
    ```
    import com.microsoft.azure.iothub.DeviceClient;
    import com.microsoft.azure.iothub.IotHubClientProtocol;
    import com.microsoft.azure.iothub.Message;
    import com.microsoft.azure.iothub.IotHubStatusCode;
    import com.microsoft.azure.iothub.IotHubEventCallback;
    import com.microsoft.azure.iothub.IotHubMessageResult;
    import com.google.gson.Gson;
    import java.io.IOException;
    import java.net.URISyntaxException;
    import java.util.Random;
    import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
    import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
    ```
7. Add the following class-level variables to the **App** class, replacing **{youriothubname}** with your IoT hub name, and **{yourdevicekey}** with the device key value you generated in the *Create a device identity* section:
   
    ```
    private static String connString = "HostName={youriothubname}.azure-devices.net;DeviceId=myFirstJavaDevice;SharedAccessKey={yourdevicekey}";
    private static IotHubClientProtocol protocol = IotHubClientProtocol.AMQPS;
    private static String deviceId = "myFirstJavaDevice";
    private static DeviceClient client;
    ```
   
    This sample application uses the **protocol** variable when it instantiates a **DeviceClient** object. You can use either the HTTPS or AMQPS protocol to communicate with IoT Hub.
8. Add the following nested **TelemetryDataPoint** class inside the **App** class to specify the telemetry data your device sends to your IoT hub:
   
    ```
    private static class TelemetryDataPoint {
      public String deviceId;
      public double windSpeed;
   
      public String serialize() {
        Gson gson = new Gson();
        return gson.toJson(this);
      }
    }
    ```
9. Add the following nested **EventCallback** class inside the **App** class to display the acknowledgement status that the IoT hub returns when it processes a message from the simulated device. This method also notifies the main thread in the application when the message has been processed:
   
    ```
    private static class EventCallback implements IotHubEventCallback
    {
      public void execute(IotHubStatusCode status, Object context) {
        System.out.println("IoT Hub responded to message with status: " + status.name());
   
        if (context != null) {
          synchronized (context) {
            context.notify();
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
10. Add the following nested **MessageSender** class inside the **App** class. The **run** method in this class generates sample telemetry data to send to your IoT hub and waits for an acknowledgement before sending the next message:
    
    ```
    private static class MessageSender implements Runnable {
      public volatile boolean stopThread = false;
    
      public void run()  {
        try {
          double avgWindSpeed = 10; // m/s
          Random rand = new Random();
    
          while (!stopThread) {
            double currentWindSpeed = avgWindSpeed + rand.nextDouble() * 4 - 2;
            TelemetryDataPoint telemetryDataPoint = new TelemetryDataPoint();
            telemetryDataPoint.deviceId = deviceId;
            telemetryDataPoint.windSpeed = currentWindSpeed;
    
            String msgStr = telemetryDataPoint.serialize();
            Message msg = new Message(msgStr);
            System.out.println("Sending: " + msgStr);
    
            Object lockobj = new Object();
            EventCallback callback = new EventCallback();
            client.sendEventAsync(msg, callback, lockobj);
    
            synchronized (lockobj) {
              lockobj.wait();
            }
            Thread.sleep(1000);
          }
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
          System.out.println("Finished.");
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    
    This method sends a new device-to-cloud message one second after the IoT hub acknowledges the previous message. The message contains a JSON-serialized object with the deviceId and a randomly generated number to simulate a wind speed sensor.
11. Replace the **main** method with the following code that creates a thread to send device-to-cloud messages to your IoT hub:
    
    ```
    public static void main( String[] args ) throws IOException, URISyntaxException {
      client = new DeviceClient(connString, protocol);
      client.open();
    
      MessageSender sender = new MessageSender();
    
      ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(1);
      executor.execute(sender);
    
      System.out.println("Press ENTER to exit.");
      System.in.read();
      executor.shutdownNow();
      client.close();
    }
    ```
12. Save and close the App.java file.
13. To build the **simulated-device** application using Maven, execute the following command at the command-prompt in the simulated-device folder:
    
    ```
    mvn clean package -DskipTests
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> To keep things simple, this tutorial does not implement any retry policy. In production code, you should implement retry policies (such as an exponential backoff), as suggested in the MSDN article [Transient Fault Handling](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh680901\(v=pandp.50\).aspx).
> 
> 

## Run the applications
You are now ready to run the applications.

1. At a command-prompt in the read-d2c folder, run the following command to begin monitoring the first partition in your IoT hub:
   
    ```
    mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.mycompany.app.App"
    ```
   
    ![](./media/iot-hub-java-java-getstarted/runapp1.png)
2. At a command-prompt in the simulated-device folder, run the following command to begin sending telemetry data to your IoT hub:
   
    ```
    mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.mycompany.app.App" 
    ```
   
    ![](./media/iot-hub-java-java-getstarted/runapp2.png)
3. The **Usage** tile in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) shows the number of messages sent to the hub:
   
    ![](./media/iot-hub-java-java-getstarted/usage.png)

## Next steps
In this tutorial, you configured a new IoT hub in the portal, and then created a device identity in the hub's identity registry. You used this device identity to enable the simulated device app to send device-to-cloud messages to the hub. You also created an app that displays the messages received by the hub.
