# IoT Gateway SDK (beta) â€“ send device-to-cloud messages with a simulated device using Windows
[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-gateway-sdk-simulated-selector](../../includes/iot-hub-gateway-sdk-simulated-selector.md)]

## Build and run the sample
Before you get started, you must:

* [Set up your development environment](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-gateway-sdk/blob/master/doc/devbox_setup.md) for working with the SDK on Windows.
* [Create an IoT hub](iot-hub-manage-through-portal.md) in your Azure subscription, you will need the name of your hub to complete this walkthrough. If you don't already have an Azure subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).
* Add two devices to your IoT hub and make a note of their ids and device keys. You can use the [Device Explorer or iothub-explorer](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks/blob/master/doc/manage_iot_hub.md) tool to add your devices to the IoT hub you created in the previous step and retrieve their keys.

To build the sample:

1. Open a **Developer Command Prompt for VS2015** command prompt.
2. Navigate to the root folder in your local copy of the **azure-iot-gateway-sdk** repository.
3. Run the **tools\\build.cmd** script. This script creates a Visual Studio solution file, builds the solution, and runs the tests. You can find the Visual Studio solution in the **build** folder in your local copy of the **azure-iot-gateway-sdk** repository.

To run the sample:

In a text editor, open the file **samples\\simulated_device_cloud_upload\\src\\simulated_device_cloud_upload_win.json** in your local copy of the **azure-iot-gateway-sdk** repository. This file configures the modules in the sample gateway:

* The **IoTHub** module connects to your IoT hub. You must configure it to send data to your IoT hub. Specifically, set the **IoTHubName** value to the name of your IoT hub and set the value of **IoTHubSuffix** to **azure-devices.net**.
* The **mapping** module maps the MAC addresses of your simulated devices to your IoT Hub device ids. Make sure that **deviceId** values match the ids of the two devices you added to your IoT hub, and that the **deviceKey** values contain the keys of your two devices.
* The **BLE1** and **BLE2** modules are the simulated devices. Note how their MAC addresses match those in the **mapping** module.
* The **Logger** module logs your gateway activity to a file.
* The **module path** values shown below assume that you cloned the Gateway SDK repository to the root of your **C:** drive. If you downloaded it to another location, you need to adjust the **module path** values accordingly.

            }
        },

            }
        },

            "module name":"Logger",
            "module path" : "C:\\azure-iot-gateway-sdk\\modules\\logger\\Debug\\logger_hl.dll",
            "args":
            {
                "filename":"C:\\azure-iot-gateway-sdk\\deviceCloudUploadGatewaylog.log"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

Save any changes you made to the configuration file.

To run the sample:

1. At a command prompt, navigate to the root folder of your local copy of the **azure-iot-gateway-sdk** repository.
2. Run the following command:
   
    ```
    build\samples\simulated_device_cloud_upload\Debug\simulated_device_cloud_upload_sample.exe samples\simulated_device_cloud_upload\src\simulated_device_cloud_upload_win.json
    ```
3. You can use the [Device Explorer or iothub-explorer](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks/blob/master/doc/manage_iot_hub.md) tool to monitor the messages that IoT hub receives from the gateway.
