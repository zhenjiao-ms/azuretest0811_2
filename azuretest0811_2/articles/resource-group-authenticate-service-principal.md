When you have an application or script that needs to access resources, you most likely do not want to run this process under a user's credentials. That user may have different permissions that you would like to assign to the process, and the user's job responsibilities could change. Instead, you can create an identity for the application that includes authentication credentials and role assignments. Your application logs in as this identity every time it runs. This topic shows you how to use [Azure PowerShell](powershell-install-configure.md) to set up everything you need for an application to run under its own credentials and identity.

In this article, you will create two objects - the Active Directory (AD) application and the service principal. The AD application contains the credentials (an application id and either a password or certificate). The service principal contains the role assignment. From the AD application, you can create many service principals. This topic focuses on a single-tenant application where the application is intended to run within only one organization. You typically use single-tenant applications for line-of-business applications that run within your organization. You can also create multi-tenant applications when your application needs to run in many organizations. You typically use multi-tenant applications for software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications. To set up a multi-tenant application, see [Developer's guide to authorization with the Azure Resource Manager API](resource-manager-api-authentication.md).

There are many concepts to understand when working with Active Directory. For a more detailed explanation of applications and service principals, see [Application Objects and Service Principal Objects](active-directory/active-directory-application-objects.md). For more information about Active Directory authentication, see [Authentication Scenarios for Azure AD](active-directory/active-directory-authentication-scenarios.md).

With PowerShell, you have 2 options for authenticating your AD application:

* password
* certificate

If, after setting up your AD application, you intend to log in to Azure from another programming framework (such Python, Ruby, or Node.js), password authentication might be your best option. Before deciding whether to use a password or certificate, see the [Sample applications](#sample-applications) section for examples of authenticating in the different frameworks.

## Get tenant ID
Whenever you sign in as a service principal, you need to provide the tenant id of the directory for your AD app. A tenant is an instance of Active Directory. Because you will need that value for either password or certificate authentication, let's get that value now. 

1. Sign in to your account.
   
        Add-AzureRmAccount
2. If you only have one subscription, you can use:
   
        $tenant = (Get-AzureRmSubscription).TenantId
   
     If you have more than one subscription, specify the subscription you will use for the AD app. Select the subscription where your Active Directory resides. For more information, see [Administer your Azure AD directory](active-directory/active-directory-administer.md).
   
        $tenant = (Get-AzureRmSubscription -SubscriptionName "Contoso Default").TenantId

Now, proceed to a section below for either [password](#create-service-principal-with-password) or [certificate](#create-service-principal-with-certificate) authentication.

## Create service principal with password
In this section, you will perform the steps to create the AD application and service principal with a password.

1. Create a new Active Directory application by providing a display name for your application, the URI to a page that describes your application (the link is not verified), the URIs that identify your application, and the password for your application identity.
   
        $azureAdApplication = New-AzureRmADApplication -DisplayName "exampleapp" -HomePage "https://www.contoso.org" -IdentifierUris "https://www.contoso.org/example" -Password "<Your_Password>"
   
     Examine the new application object. 
   
        $azureAdApplication
   
     Note in particular the **ApplicationId** property which is needed for creating service principals, role assignments and acquiring the access token.
   
        DisplayName             : exampleapp
        Type                    : Application
        ApplicationId           : 8bc80782-a916-47c8-a47e-4d76ed755275
        ApplicationObjectId     : c95e67a3-403c-40ac-9377-115fa48f8f39
        AvailableToOtherTenants : False
        AppPermissions          : {}
        IdentifierUris          : {https://www.contoso.org/example}
        ReplyUrls               : {}

     From your AD application, you must create a service principal and assign a role to it.

1. Create a service principal for your application by passing in the application id of the Active Directory application.
   
        New-AzureRmADServicePrincipal -ApplicationId $azureAdApplication.ApplicationId
2. Grant the service principal permissions on your subscription. In this sample you will grant the service principal the permission to Read all resources in the subscription. For the **ServicePrincipalName** parameter, provide either the **ApplicationId** or the **IdentifierUris** that you used when creating the application. For more information on role-based access control, see [Azure Role-based Access Control](active-directory/role-based-access-control-configure.md). To assign a role, you must have `Microsoft.Authorization/*/Write` access which is granted through the [Owner](active-directory/role-based-access-built-in-roles.md#owner) role or [User Access Administrator](active-directory/role-based-access-built-in-roles.md#user-access-administrator) role.
   
        New-AzureRmRoleAssignment -RoleDefinitionName Reader -ServicePrincipalName $azureAdApplication.ApplicationId.Guid

That's it! Your AD application and service principal are set up. The next section shows you how to log in with the credential through PowerShell; however, if you want to use the credential in your code application, you do not need to continue with this topic. You can jump to the [Sample applications](#sample-applications) for examples of logging in with your application id and password. 

### Provide credentials through PowerShell
Now, you need to login as the application to perform operations.

1. Create a new **PSCredential** object which contains your credentials by running the **Get-Credential** command. You will need the **ApplicationId** or **IdentifierUris** prior to running this command so make sure you have that available to paste.
   
        $creds = Get-Credential
2. You will be prompted you to enter your credentials. For the user name, use the **ApplicationId** or **IdentifierUris** that you used when creating the application. For the password, use the one you specified when creating the account.
   
     ![enter credentials](./media/resource-group-authenticate-service-principal/arm-get-credential.png)
3. Login as the service principal by specifying that this account is a service principal and by providing the credentials object. You will need the tenant id you retrieved at [Get tenant ID](#get-tenant-id).
   
        Add-AzureRmAccount -Credential $creds -ServicePrincipal -TenantId $tenant
   
     You are now authenticated as the service principal for the Active Directory application that you created.
4. To use the current access token in a later session, you can save the profile.
   
        Save-AzureRmProfile -Path c:\Users\exampleuser\profile\exampleSP.json
   
     You can open the profile and examine its contents. Notice that it contains an access token. 
5. Instead of manually logging in again the next time you wish to execute code as the service principal, simply load the profile.
   
        Select-AzureRmProfile -Path c:\Users\exampleuser\profile\exampleSP.json

> [!NOTE]
> The access token will expire, so using a saved profile only works for as long as the token is valid.
> 
> 

## Create service principal with certificate
In this section, you will perform the steps to create an AD application and service principal with a certificate. 

1. Create a self-signed certificate. If you are have **Windows 10 or Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview**, run the following command: 
   
        $cert = New-SelfSignedCertificate -CertStoreLocation "cert:\CurrentUser\My" -Subject "CN=exampleapp" -KeySpec KeyExchange
   
     You variable contains information about the certificate, including the thumbprint.
   
        Directory: Microsoft.PowerShell.Security\Certificate::CurrentUser\My
   
        Thumbprint                                Subject
        ----------                                -------
        724213129BD2B950BB3F64FAB0C877E9348B16E9  CN=exampleapp
   
     If you **do not** have Windows 10 or Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview, you will not have the **New-SelfSignedCertificate** cmdlet. Instead, download the [Self-signed certificate generator](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/Self-signed-certificate-5920a7c6) PowerShell script, and run the following commands to generate a certificate. This step is not necessary if you already created the certificate in the previous example.
   
        # Only run if you could not use New-SelfSignedCertificate
        Import-Module -Name c:\New-SelfSignedCertificateEx.ps1
        New-SelfSignedCertificateEx -Subject "CN=exampleapp" -KeySpec "Exchange" -FriendlyName "exampleapp"
        $cert = Get-ChildItem -Path cert:\CurrentUser\My\* -DnsName exampleapp
2. Retrieve the key value from the certificate.
   
        $keyValue = [System.Convert]::ToBase64String($cert.GetRawCertData())
3. Create an application in the directory.
   
        $azureAdApplication = New-AzureRmADApplication -DisplayName "exampleapp" -HomePage "https://www.contoso.org" -IdentifierUris "https://www.contoso.org/example" -KeyValue $keyValue -KeyType AsymmetricX509Cert -EndDate $cert.NotAfter -StartDate $cert.NotBefore      
   
    Examine the new application object. 
   
        $azureAdApplication
   
    Notice the **ApplicationId** property which is needed for creating service principals, role assignments and acquiring access tokens.
   
        DisplayName             : exampleapp
        Type                    : Application
        ApplicationId           : 1975a4fd-1528-4086-a992-787dbd23c46b
        ApplicationObjectId     : 9665e5f3-84b7-4344-92e2-8cc20ad16a8b
        AvailableToOtherTenants : False
        AppPermissions          : {}
        IdentifierUris          : {https://www.contoso.org/example}
        ReplyUrls               : {}    
4. Create a service principal for your application by passing in the application id of the Active Directory application.
   
        New-AzureRmADServicePrincipal -ApplicationId $azureAdApplication.ApplicationId
5. Grant the service principal permissions on your subscription. In this sample you will grant the service principal the permission to Read all resources in the subscription. For the **ServicePrincipalName** parameter, provide either the **ApplicationId** or the **IdentifierUris** that you used when creating the application. For more information on role-based access control, see [Azure Role-based Access Control](active-directory/role-based-access-control-configure.md). To assign a role, you must have `Microsoft.Authorization/*/Write` access which is granted through the [Owner](active-directory/role-based-access-built-in-roles.md#owner) role or [User Access Administrator](active-directory/role-based-access-built-in-roles.md#user-access-administrator) role.
   
        New-AzureRmRoleAssignment -RoleDefinitionName Reader -ServicePrincipalName $azureAdApplication.ApplicationId.Guid

That's it! Your AD application and service principal are set up. The next section shows you how to log in with certificate through PowerShell.

### Provide certificate through automated PowerShell script
To authenticate in your script, specify the account is a service principal and provide the certificate thumbprint, the application id, and tenant id. You already have these values in the variables **$azureAdApplication.ApplicationId**, **$cert.Thumbprint**, and **$tenant**. To automate your script, you can store these values as environment variables and retrieve them during execution, or you can include them in your script.

    Add-AzureRmAccount -ServicePrincipal -CertificateThumbprint 000000 -ApplicationId 000000 -TenantId 0000000

You are now authenticated as the service principal for the Active Directory application that you created.

If you need to retrieve the application id later, use:

    (Get-AzureRmADApplication -IdentifierUri "https://www.contoso.org/example").ApplicationId

If you need to retrieve the certificate thumbprint later, use:

    (Get-ChildItem -Path cert:\CurrentUser\My\* -DnsName exampleapp).Thumbprint

If you need to retrieve the tenant id later, see [Get tenant ID](#get-tenant-id).
