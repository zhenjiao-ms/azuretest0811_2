[!INCLUDE [azure-ps-prerequisites-include.md](../../includes/azure-ps-prerequisites-include.md)]

## Create a new application gateway
To create an application gateway:

1. Create an application gateway resource.
2. Create a configuration XML file or a configuration object.
3. Commit the configuration to the newly created application gateway resource.

### Create an application gateway resource
To create the gateway, use the **New-AzureApplicationGateway** cmdlet, replacing the values with your own. Note that billing for the gateway does not start at this point. Billing begins in a later step, when the gateway is successfully started.

The following example creates a new application gateway by using a virtual network called "testvnet1" and a subnet called "subnet-1".

    PS C:\> New-AzureApplicationGateway -Name AppGwTest -VnetName testvnet1 -Subnets @("Subnet-1")

    VERBOSE: 4:31:35 PM - Begin Operation: New-AzureApplicationGateway
    VERBOSE: 4:32:37 PM - Completed Operation: New-AzureApplicationGateway
    Name       HTTP Status Code     Operation ID                             Error
    ----       ----------------     ------------                             ----
    Successful OK                   55ef0460-825d-2981-ad20-b9a8af41b399


 *Description*, *InstanceCount*, and *GatewaySize* are optional parameters.

To validate that the gateway was created, you can use the **Get-AzureApplicationGateway** cmdlet.

    PS C:\> Get-AzureApplicationGateway AppGwTest
    Name          : AppGwTest
    Description   :
    VnetName      : testvnet1
    Subnets       : {Subnet-1}
    InstanceCount : 2
    GatewaySize   : Medium
    State         : Stopped
    VirtualIPs    : {}
    DnsName       :

> [!NOTE]
> The default value for *InstanceCount* is 2, with a maximum value of 10. The default value for *GatewaySize* is Medium. You can choose between Small, Medium, and Large.
> 
> 

 *VirtualIPs* and *DnsName* are shown as blank because the gateway has not started yet. These will be created once the gateway is in the running state.

## Configure an application gateway
You can configure the application gateway by using XML or a configuration object.

## Configure an application gateway by using XML
In the following example, you will use an XML file to configure all application gateway settings and commit them to the application gateway resource.  

### Step 1
Copy the following text to Notepad.

    <ApplicationGatewayConfiguration xmlns:i="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/windowsazure">
    <FrontendIPConfigurations>
        <FrontendIPConfiguration>
            <Name>fip1</Name>
            <Type>Private</Type>
        </FrontendIPConfiguration>
    </FrontendIPConfigurations>    
    <FrontendPorts>
        <FrontendPort>
            <Name>port1</Name>
            <Port>80</Port>
        </FrontendPort>
    </FrontendPorts>
    <Probes>
        <Probe>
            <Name>Probe01</Name>
            <Protocol>Http</Protocol>
            <Host>contoso.com</Host>
            <Path>/path/custompath.htm</Path>
            <Interval>15</Interval>
            <Timeout>15</Timeout>
            <UnhealthyThreshold>5</UnhealthyThreshold>
        </Probe>
      </Probes>
     <BackendAddressPools>
        <BackendAddressPool>
            <Name>pool1</Name>
            <IPAddresses>
                <IPAddress>1.1.1.1</IPAddress>
                <IPAddress>2.2.2.2</IPAddress>
            </IPAddresses>
        </BackendAddressPool>
    </BackendAddressPools>
    <BackendHttpSettingsList>
        <BackendHttpSettings>
            <Name>setting1</Name>
            <Port>80</Port>
            <Protocol>Http</Protocol>
            <CookieBasedAffinity>Enabled</CookieBasedAffinity>
            <RequestTimeout>120</RequestTimeout>
            <Probe>Probe01</Probe>
        </BackendHttpSettings>
    </BackendHttpSettingsList>
    <HttpListeners>
        <HttpListener>
            <Name>listener1</Name>
            <FrontendIP>fip1</FrontendIP>
        <FrontendPort>port1</FrontendPort>
            <Protocol>Http</Protocol>
        </HttpListener>
    </HttpListeners>
    <HttpLoadBalancingRules>
        <HttpLoadBalancingRule>
            <Name>lbrule1</Name>
            <Type>basic</Type>
            <BackendHttpSettings>setting1</BackendHttpSettings>
            <Listener>listener1</Listener>
            <BackendAddressPool>pool1</BackendAddressPool>
        </HttpLoadBalancingRule>
    </HttpLoadBalancingRules>
    </ApplicationGatewayConfiguration>


Edit the values between the parentheses for the configuration items. Save the file with extension .xml.

The following example shows how to use a configuration file to set up the application gateway to load balance HTTP traffic on public port 80 and send network traffic to back-end port 80 between two IP addresses by using a custom probe.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The protocol item Http or Https is case-sensitive.
> 
> 

A new configuration item <Probe> is added to configure custom probes.

The configuration parameters are:

* **Name** - Reference name for custom probe.
* **Protocol** - Protocol used (possible values are HTTP or HTTPS).
* **Host** and **Path** - Complete URL path that is invoked by the application gateway to determine the health of the instance. For example, if you have a website http://contoso.com/, then the custom probe can be configured for "http://contoso.com/path/custompath.htm" for probe checks to have a successful HTTP response.
* **Interval** - Configures the probe interval checks in seconds.
* **Timeout** - Defines the probe time-out for an HTTP response check.
* **UnhealthyThreshold** - The number of failed HTTP responses needed to flag the back-end instance as *unhealthy*.

The probe name is referenced in the <BackendHttpSettings> configuration to assign which back-end pool will use custom probe settings.

## Add a custom probe configuration to an existing application gateway
Changing the current configuration of an application gateway requires three steps: Get the current XML configuration file, modify to have a custom probe, and configure the application gateway with the new XML settings.

### Step 1
Get the XML file by using get-AzureApplicationGatewayConfig. This will export the configuration XML to be modified to add a probe setting.

    get-AzureApplicationGatewayConfig -Name <application gateway name> -Exporttofile "<path to file>"


### Step 2
Open the XML file in a text editor. Add a `<probe>` section after `<frontendport>`.

    <Probes>
        <Probe>
            <Name>Probe01</Name>
            <Protocol>Http</Protocol>
            <Host>contoso.com</Host>
            <Path>/path/custompath.htm</Path>
            <Interval>15</Interval>
            <Timeout>15</Timeout>
            <UnhealthyThreshold>5</UnhealthyThreshold>
        </Probe>

In the backendHttpSettings section of the XML, add the probe name as shown in the example below:

        <BackendHttpSettings>
            <Name>setting1</Name>
            <Port>80</Port>
            <Protocol>Http</Protocol>
            <CookieBasedAffinity>Enabled</CookieBasedAffinity>
            <RequestTimeout>120</RequestTimeout>
            <Probe>Probe01</Probe>
        </BackendHttpSettings>

Save the XML file.

### Step 3
Update the application gateway configuration with the new XML file by using **Set-AzureApplicationGatewayConfig**. This will update your application gateway with the new configuration.

    set-AzureApplicationGatewayConfig -Name <application gateway name> -Configfile "<path to file>"
