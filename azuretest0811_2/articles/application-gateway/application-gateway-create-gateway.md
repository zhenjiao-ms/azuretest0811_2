# Create, start, or delete an application gateway
Azure Application Gateway is a layer-7 load balancer. It provides failover, performance-routing HTTP requests between different servers, whether they are on the cloud or on-premises. Application Gateway has the following application delivery features: HTTP load balancing, cookie-based session affinity, and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) offload.

This article walks you through the steps to create, configure, start, and delete an application gateway.

## Before you begin
1. Install the latest version of the Azure PowerShell cmdlets by using the Web Platform Installer. You can download and install the latest version from the **Windows PowerShell** section of the [Downloads page](https://azure.microsoft.com/downloads/).
2. If you have an existing virtual network, either select an existing empty subnet or create a new subnet in your existing virtual network solely for use by the application gateway. You cannot deploy the application gateway to a different virtual network than the resources you intend to deploy behind the application gateway.
3. Verify that you have a working virtual network with a valid subnet. Make sure that no virtual machines or cloud deployments are using the subnet. The application gateway must be by itself in a virtual network subnet.
4. The servers that you will configure to use the application gateway must exist or have their endpoints created either in the virtual network or with a public IP/VIP assigned.

## What is required to create an application gateway?
When you use the **New-AzureApplicationGateway** command to create the application gateway, no configuration is set at this point and the newly created resource will have to be configured either by using XML or a configuration object.

The values are:

* **Back-end server pool:** The list of IP addresses of the back-end servers. The IP addresses listed should either belong to the virtual network subnet or should be a public IP/VIP.
* **Back-end server pool settings:** Every pool has settings like port, protocol, and cookie-based affinity. These settings are tied to a pool and are applied to all servers within the pool.
* **Front-end port:** This port is the public port that is opened on the application gateway. Traffic hits this port, and then gets redirected to one of the back-end servers.
* **Listener:** The listener has a front-end port, a protocol (Http or Https, these are case-sensitive), and the SSL certificate name (if configuring SSL offload).
* **Rule:** The rule binds the listener and the back-end server pool and defines which back-end server pool the traffic should be directed to when it hits a particular listener.

## Create a new application gateway
To create an application gateway:

1. Create an application gateway resource.
2. Create a configuration XML file or a configuration object.
3. Commit the configuration to the newly created application gateway resource.

> [!NOTE]
> If you need to configure a custom probe for your application gateway, see [Create an application gateway with custom probes by using PowerShell](application-gateway-create-probe-classic-ps.md). Check out [custom probes and health monitoring](application-gateway-probe-overview.md) for more information.
> 
> 

### Create an application gateway resource
To create the gateway, use the **New-AzureApplicationGateway** cmdlet, replacing the values with your own. Note that billing for the gateway does not start at this point. Billing begins in a later step, when the gateway is successfully started.

The following example creates a new application gateway by using a virtual network called "testvnet1" and a subnet called "subnet-1".

    New-AzureApplicationGateway -Name AppGwTest -VnetName testvnet1 -Subnets @("Subnet-1")

    VERBOSE: 4:31:35 PM - Begin Operation: New-AzureApplicationGateway
    VERBOSE: 4:32:37 PM - Completed Operation: New-AzureApplicationGateway
    Name       HTTP Status Code     Operation ID                             Error
    ----       ----------------     ------------                             ----
    Successful OK                   55ef0460-825d-2981-ad20-b9a8af41b399


 *Description*, *InstanceCount*, and *GatewaySize* are optional parameters.

To validate that the gateway was created, you can use the **Get-AzureApplicationGateway** cmdlet.

    Get-AzureApplicationGateway AppGwTest
    Name          : AppGwTest
    Description   :
    VnetName      : testvnet1
    Subnets       : {Subnet-1}
    InstanceCount : 2
    GatewaySize   : Medium
    State         : Stopped
    VirtualIPs    : {}
    DnsName       :

> [!NOTE]
> The default value for *InstanceCount* is 2, with a maximum value of 10. The default value for *GatewaySize* is Medium. You can choose between Small, Medium and Large.
> 
> 

 *VirtualIPs* and *DnsName* are shown as blank because the gateway has not started yet. These will be created once the gateway is in the running state.

## Configure the application gateway
You can configure the application gateway by using XML or a configuration object.

## Configure the application gateway by using XML
In the following example, you will use an XML file to configure all application gateway settings and commit them to the application gateway resource.  

### Step 1
Copy the following text to Notepad.

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <ApplicationGatewayConfiguration xmlns:i="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/windowsazure">
        <FrontendPorts>
            <FrontendPort>
                <Name>(name-of-your-frontend-port)</Name>
                <Port>(port number)</Port>
            </FrontendPort>
        </FrontendPorts>
        <BackendAddressPools>
            <BackendAddressPool>
                <Name>(name-of-your-backend-pool)</Name>
                <IPAddresses>
                    <IPAddress>(your-IP-address-for-backend-pool)</IPAddress>
                    <IPAddress>(your-second-IP-address-for-backend-pool)</IPAddress>
                </IPAddresses>
            </BackendAddressPool>
        </BackendAddressPools>
        <BackendHttpSettingsList>
            <BackendHttpSettings>
                <Name>(backend-setting-name-to-configure-rule)</Name>
                <Port>80</Port>
                <Protocol>[Http|Https]</Protocol>
                <CookieBasedAffinity>Enabled</CookieBasedAffinity>
            </BackendHttpSettings>
        </BackendHttpSettingsList>
        <HttpListeners>
            <HttpListener>
                <Name>(name-of-the-listener)</Name>
                <FrontendPort>(name-of-your-frontend-port)</FrontendPort>
                <Protocol>[Http|Https]</Protocol>
            </HttpListener>
        </HttpListeners>
        <HttpLoadBalancingRules>
            <HttpLoadBalancingRule>
                <Name>(name-of-load-balancing-rule)</Name>
                <Type>basic</Type>
                <BackendHttpSettings>(backend-setting-name-to-configure-rule)</BackendHttpSettings>
                <Listener>(name-of-the-listener)</Listener>
                <BackendAddressPool>(name-of-your-backend-pool)</BackendAddressPool>
            </HttpLoadBalancingRule>
        </HttpLoadBalancingRules>
    </ApplicationGatewayConfiguration>

Edit the values between the parentheses for the configuration items. Save the file with extension .xml.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The protocol item Http or Https is case-sensitive.
> 
> 

The following example shows how to use a configuration file to set up the application gateway to load balance HTTP traffic on public port 80 and send network traffic to back-end port 80 between two IP addresses.

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <ApplicationGatewayConfiguration xmlns:i="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/windowsazure">
        <FrontendPorts>
            <FrontendPort>
                <Name>FrontendPort1</Name>
                <Port>80</Port>
            </FrontendPort>
        </FrontendPorts>
        <BackendAddressPools>
            <BackendAddressPool>
                <Name>BackendPool1</Name>
                <IPAddresses>
                    <IPAddress>10.0.0.1</IPAddress>
                    <IPAddress>10.0.0.2</IPAddress>
                </IPAddresses>
            </BackendAddressPool>
        </BackendAddressPools>
        <BackendHttpSettingsList>
            <BackendHttpSettings>
                <Name>BackendSetting1</Name>
                <Port>80</Port>
                <Protocol>Http</Protocol>
                <CookieBasedAffinity>Enabled</CookieBasedAffinity>
            </BackendHttpSettings>
        </BackendHttpSettingsList>
        <HttpListeners>
            <HttpListener>
                <Name>HTTPListener1</Name>
                <FrontendPort>FrontendPort1</FrontendPort>
                <Protocol>Http</Protocol>
            </HttpListener>
        </HttpListeners>
        <HttpLoadBalancingRules>
            <HttpLoadBalancingRule>
                <Name>HttpLBRule1</Name>
                <Type>basic</Type>
                <BackendHttpSettings>BackendSetting1</BackendHttpSettings>
                <Listener>HTTPListener1</Listener>
                <BackendAddressPool>BackendPool1</BackendAddressPool>
            </HttpLoadBalancingRule>
        </HttpLoadBalancingRules>
    </ApplicationGatewayConfiguration>


### Step 2
Next, set the application gateway. Use the **Set-AzureApplicationGatewayConfig** cmdlet with a configuration XML file.

    Set-AzureApplicationGatewayConfig -Name AppGwTest -ConfigFile "D:\config.xml"

    VERBOSE: 7:54:59 PM - Begin Operation: Set-AzureApplicationGatewayConfig
    VERBOSE: 7:55:32 PM - Completed Operation: Set-AzureApplicationGatewayConfig
    Name       HTTP Status Code     Operation ID                             Error
    ----       ----------------     ------------                             ----
    Successful OK                   9b995a09-66fe-2944-8b67-9bb04fcccb9d

## Configure the application gateway by using a configuration object
The following example shows how to configure the application gateway by using configuration objects. All configuration items have to be configured individually and then added to an application gateway configuration object. After creating the configuration object, you will use the **Set-AzureApplicationGateway** command to commit the configuration to the previously created application gateway resource.

> [!NOTE]
> Before assigning a value to each configuration object, you need to declare what kind of object PowerShell uses for storage. The first line to create the individual items defines what Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Commands.ServiceManagement.Network.ApplicationGateway.Model(object name) will be used.
> 
> 

### Step 1
Create all individual configuration items.

Create the front-end IP as shown in the following example.

    PS C:\> $fip = New-Object Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Commands.ServiceManagement.Network.ApplicationGateway.Model.FrontendIPConfiguration
    PS C:\> $fip.Name = "fip1"
    PS C:\> $fip.Type = "Private"
    PS C:\> $fip.StaticIPAddress = "10.0.0.5"

Create the front-end port as shown in the following example.

    PS C:\> $fep = New-Object Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Commands.ServiceManagement.Network.ApplicationGateway.Model.FrontendPort
    PS C:\> $fep.Name = "fep1"
    PS C:\> $fep.Port = 80

Create the back-end server pool.

 Define the IP addresses that will be added to the back-end server pool as shown in the next example.

    PS C:\> $servers = New-Object Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Commands.ServiceManagement.Network.ApplicationGateway.Model.BackendServerCollection
    PS C:\> $servers.Add("10.0.0.1")
    PS C:\> $servers.Add("10.0.0.2")

 Use the $server object to add the values to the back-end pool object ($pool).

    PS C:\> $pool = New-Object Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Commands.ServiceManagement.Network.ApplicationGateway.Model.BackendAddressPool
    PS C:\> $pool.BackendServers = $servers
    PS C:\> $pool.Name = "pool1"

Create the back-end server pool setting.

    PS C:\> $setting = New-Object Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Commands.ServiceManagement.Network.ApplicationGateway.Model.BackendHttpSettings
    PS C:\> $setting.Name = "setting1"
    PS C:\> $setting.CookieBasedAffinity = "enabled"
    PS C:\> $setting.Port = 80
    PS C:\> $setting.Protocol = "http"

Create the listener.

    PS C:\> $listener = New-Object Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Commands.ServiceManagement.Network.ApplicationGateway.Model.HttpListener
    PS C:\> $listener.Name = "listener1"
    PS C:\> $listener.FrontendPort = "fep1"
    PS C:\> $listener.FrontendIP = "fip1"
    PS C:\> $listener.Protocol = "http"
    PS C:\> $listener.SslCert = ""

Create the rule.

    PS C:\> $rule = New-Object Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Commands.ServiceManagement.Network.ApplicationGateway.Model.HttpLoadBalancingRule
    PS C:\> $rule.Name = "rule1"
    PS C:\> $rule.Type = "basic"
    PS C:\> $rule.BackendHttpSettings = "setting1"
    PS C:\> $rule.Listener = "listener1"
    PS C:\> $rule.BackendAddressPool = "pool1"

### Step 2
Assign all individual configuration items to an application gateway configuration object ($appgwconfig).

Add the front-end IP to the configuration.

    PS C:\> $appgwconfig = New-Object Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Commands.ServiceManagement.Network.ApplicationGateway.Model.ApplicationGatewayConfiguration
    PS C:\> $appgwconfig.FrontendIPConfigurations = New-Object "System.Collections.Generic.List[Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Commands.ServiceManagement.Network.ApplicationGateway.Model.FrontendIPConfiguration]"
    PS C:\> $appgwconfig.FrontendIPConfigurations.Add($fip)

Add the front-end port to the configuration.

    PS C:\> $appgwconfig.FrontendPorts = New-Object "System.Collections.Generic.List[Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Commands.ServiceManagement.Network.ApplicationGateway.Model.FrontendPort]"
    PS C:\> $appgwconfig.FrontendPorts.Add($fep)

Add the back-end server pool to the configuration.

    PS C:\> $appgwconfig.BackendAddressPools = New-Object "System.Collections.Generic.List[Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Commands.ServiceManagement.Network.ApplicationGateway.Model.BackendAddressPool]"
    PS C:\> $appgwconfig.BackendAddressPools.Add($pool)  

Add the back-end pool setting to the configuration.

    PS C:\> $appgwconfig.BackendHttpSettingsList = New-Object "System.Collections.Generic.List[Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Commands.ServiceManagement.Network.ApplicationGateway.Model.BackendHttpSettings]"
    PS C:\> $appgwconfig.BackendHttpSettingsList.Add($setting)

Add the listener to the configuration.

    PS C:\> $appgwconfig.HttpListeners = New-Object "System.Collections.Generic.List[Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Commands.ServiceManagement.Network.ApplicationGateway.Model.HttpListener]"
    PS C:\> $appgwconfig.HttpListeners.Add($listener)

Add the rule to the configuration.

    PS C:\> $appgwconfig.HttpLoadBalancingRules = New-Object "System.Collections.Generic.List[Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Commands.ServiceManagement.Network.ApplicationGateway.Model.HttpLoadBalancingRule]"
    PS C:\> $appgwconfig.HttpLoadBalancingRules.Add($rule)

### Step 3
Commit the configuration object to the application gateway resource by using **Set-AzureApplicationGatewayConfig**.

    Set-AzureApplicationGatewayConfig -Name AppGwTest -Config $appgwconfig

## Start the gateway
Once the gateway has been configured, use the **Start-AzureApplicationGateway** cmdlet to start the gateway. Billing for an application gateway begins after the gateway has been successfully started.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Start-AzureApplicationGateway** cmdlet might take up to 15-20 minutes to finish.
> 
> 

    Start-AzureApplicationGateway AppGwTest

    VERBOSE: 7:59:16 PM - Begin Operation: Start-AzureApplicationGateway
    VERBOSE: 8:05:52 PM - Completed Operation: Start-AzureApplicationGateway
    Name       HTTP Status Code     Operation ID                             Error
    ----       ----------------     ------------                             ----
    Successful OK                   fc592db8-4c58-2c8e-9a1d-1c97880f0b9b

## Verify the gateway status
Use the **Get-AzureApplicationGateway** cmdlet to check the status of the gateway. If **Start-AzureApplicationGateway** succeeded in the previous step, *State* should be Running, and *Vip* and *DnsName* should have valid entries.

The following example shows an application gateway that is up, running, and ready to take traffic destined for `http://<generated-dns-name>.cloudapp.net`.

    Get-AzureApplicationGateway AppGwTest

    VERBOSE: 8:09:28 PM - Begin Operation: Get-AzureApplicationGateway
    VERBOSE: 8:09:30 PM - Completed Operation: Get-AzureApplicationGateway
    Name          : AppGwTest
    Description   :
    VnetName      : testvnet1
    Subnets       : {Subnet-1}
    InstanceCount : 2
    GatewaySize   : Medium
    State         : Running
    Vip           : 138.91.170.26
    DnsName       : appgw-1b8402e8-3e0d-428d-b661-289c16c82101.cloudapp.net


## Delete an application gateway
To delete an application gateway:

1. Use the **Stop-AzureApplicationGateway** cmdlet to stop the gateway.
2. Use the **Remove-AzureApplicationGateway** cmdlet to remove the gateway.
3. Verify that the gateway has been removed by using the **Get-AzureApplicationGateway** cmdlet.

The following example shows the **Stop-AzureApplicationGateway** cmdlet on the first line, followed by the output.

    Stop-AzureApplicationGateway AppGwTest

    VERBOSE: 9:49:34 PM - Begin Operation: Stop-AzureApplicationGateway
    VERBOSE: 10:10:06 PM - Completed Operation: Stop-AzureApplicationGateway
    Name       HTTP Status Code     Operation ID                             Error
    ----       ----------------     ------------                             ----
    Successful OK                   ce6c6c95-77b4-2118-9d65-e29defadffb8

Once the application gateway is in a stopped state, use the **Remove-AzureApplicationGateway** cmdlet to remove the service.

    Remove-AzureApplicationGateway AppGwTest

    VERBOSE: 10:49:34 PM - Begin Operation: Remove-AzureApplicationGateway
    VERBOSE: 10:50:36 PM - Completed Operation: Remove-AzureApplicationGateway
    Name       HTTP Status Code     Operation ID                             Error
    ----       ----------------     ------------                             ----
    Successful OK                   055f3a96-8681-2094-a304-8d9a11ad8301

To verify that the service has been removed, you can use the **Get-AzureApplicationGateway** cmdlet. This step is not required.

    Get-AzureApplicationGateway AppGwTest

    VERBOSE: 10:52:46 PM - Begin Operation: Get-AzureApplicationGateway

    Get-AzureApplicationGateway : ResourceNotFound: The gateway does not exist.
