# Service Bus samples
The Service Bus samples demonstrate key features in [Service Bus](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/service-bus/) (cloud service) and [Service Bus for Windows Server](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn282144.aspx). This article categorizes and describes the samples available, with links to each.

> [!NOTE]
> Service Bus samples are not installed with the SDK. To obtain the samples, visit the [Azure SDK samples page](https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/site/search?query=service%20bus&f%5B0%5D.Value=service%20bus&f%5B0%5D.Type=SearchText&ac=5).
> 
> Additionally, there is an updated set of Service Bus messaging samples [here](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-servicebus-messaging-samples) (as of this writing, they are not described in this article). Relay samples are [here](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-servicebus-relay-samples).

## Service Bus brokered messaging
The following samples illustrate how to write applications that use Service Bus.

Note that the brokered messaging samples require a connection string to access your Service Bus service namespace.

### To obtain a connection string for Azure Service Bus
1. Log on to the [Azure classic portal](http://manage.windowsazure.com).
2. In the left-hand column, click **Service Bus**.
3. Click the name of your service namespace in the list.
4. Click **Connection Information**. In the **Access connection information** dialog, copy the connection string to your clipboard.
5. Paste the connection string into the App.config file for the sample.

### To obtain a connection string for Service Bus for Windows Server
1. Run the following PowerShell cmdlet:
   
    ```
    get-sbClientConfiguration
    ```
2. Paste the connection string into the App.config file for the sample.
