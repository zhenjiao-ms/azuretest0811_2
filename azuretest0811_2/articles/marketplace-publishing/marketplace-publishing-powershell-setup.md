# Set up Azure PowerShell to create an offer for the Azure Marketplace
For detailed information on how to set up PowerShell in Azure, see [How to install and configure Azure PowerShell](../powershell-install-configure.md). A simple approach is to use the certificate method, which downloads and imports a certificate needed for authentication. To obtain the needed certificate, use the **Get-AzurePublishSettingsFile** cmdlet. Save the file when you're prompted. To import the certificate into a PowerShell session, use the **Import-AzurePublishSettingsFile** cmdlet.

To configure and store the common Microsoft Azure subscription settings for the PowerShell session, use the **Set-AzureSubscription** and **Select-AzureSubscription** cmdlets:

        Set-AzureSubscription -SubscriptionName “mySubName” -CurrentStorageAccountName “mystorageaccount”
        Select-AzureSubscription -SubscriptionName "mySubName" –Current

The first command associates a default storage account with the subscription (needed for some VM provisioning operations).  The second makes the subscription the current one (recognized by other cmdlets).
