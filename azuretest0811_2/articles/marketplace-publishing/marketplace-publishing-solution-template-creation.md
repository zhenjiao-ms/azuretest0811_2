# Guide to create a solution template for Azure Marketplace
After completing step 1, [Account creation and registration](marketplace-publishing-accounts-creation-registration.md), we guided you on the creation of an Azure-compatible solution template at [Technical prerequisites for creating a solution template](marketplace-publishing-solution-template-creation-prerequisites.md). Now we will walk you through the steps for creating a solution template for multiple VMs on the [Publishing Portal](https://publish.windowsazure.com) for the Azure Marketplace.

## Create your solution template offer in the Publishing Portal
Go to  [https://publish.windowsazure.com](http://publish.windowsazure.com). When signing in for the first time to the [Publishing Portal](https://publish.windowsazure.com/), use the same account with which your company’s seller profile was registered. Later, you can add any employee of your company as a co-admin in the Publishing Portal.

### 1. Select "Solution templates"

### 2. Create a new solution template

### 3. Start with topologies
A solution template is a "parent" to all of its topologies. You can define multiple topologies in one offer/solution template. When an offer is pushed to staging, it is pushed with all of its topologies. Follow the steps below to define your offer:     

* Create a Topology: “Topology Identifier” is typically the name of the topology for the solution template. The topology identifier is used in the URL as shown below:
  
  Azure Marketplace:
  http://azure.microsoft.com/marketplace/partners/{PublisherNamespace}/{OfferIdentifier}{TopologyIdentifier}
  
  Azure Portal:
  https://portal.azure.com/#gallery/{PublisherNamespace}.{OfferIdentifier}{TopologyIdentifier}
* Add a new version.

### 4. Get your topology versions certified
Upload a zip file that contains all required files to provision that particular version of the topology. This zip file must contain the following:

* *mainTemplate.json* and *createUiDefinition.json* file at its root directory.
* Any linked templates and all required scripts.
  
  > [!TIP]
  > While your developers work on creating the solution template topologies and getting them certified, the business, marketing, and/or legal departments of your company can work on the marketing and legal content.
  > 
  > 

## Next steps
Now that you created your solution template and uploaded the zip file, please follow the instructions in the [Marketplace marketing content guide](marketplace-publishing-push-to-staging.md) before pushing the offer to staging.
