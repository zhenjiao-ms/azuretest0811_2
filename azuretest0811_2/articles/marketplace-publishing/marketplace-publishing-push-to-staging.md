# Complete the offer creation with marketing content
In this step of the publishing process, you will need to provide certain marketing content and details about your offer and/or SKUs in the Azure Marketplace. For example, you will provide a description of your product, company logos, price plans, details of plans, and other information necessary to push your offer and/or SKU to staging. This information is used as marketing content in the Azure portal. You will begin this process in the [publishing portal](https://publish.windowsazure.com).

## Step 1: Provide Marketplace marketing content
**English is the default and only supported language.** Please ensure that all information provided in the fields is in English. All information can be edited at any time until you push to staging.

1. Go to the publishing portal, [https://publish.windowsazure.com](https://publish.windowsazure.com).
2. On the left menu, click the **Marketing** tab.
3. In the main panel, click the **English (US)** button.
   
   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > All fields must have entries, including the images, for you to be able to push to staging.
   > 
   > 

### Details and plans
1. Enter the offer title (maximum 50 characters), offer summary (maximum 100 characters), offer long summary (maximum 256 characters), offer description (maximum 1300 characters), logos under the **Details** tab
2. Enter plan title (maximum 50 characters), plan summary (maximum 100 characters), plan description (maximum 2000 characters) under the **Plans** tab.
   
   > [!NOTE]
   > You can use the following HTML tags to format the summary, long summary and description of the offer and plans. The allowed HTML tags are h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, p, ol, ul, li, a[target|href], strong, em, b, i.
   > 
3. Do not enter duplicate text under offer and plan description.
4. Do not enter duplicate text under plan’s title and offer long summary.
5. Do not enter duplicate text under plan title and offer summary.
6. Do not enter identical plan titles for an offer with multiple plans.
7. Upload images of the required specifications (mentioned in the Publishing Portal) in PNG format, one for each size.
8. Ensure that the logos follow the Azure Marketplace logo guidelines mentioned below.
   
   ![drawing](media/marketplace-publishing-push-to-staging/pubportal-marketingcontent-details-02.png)

**Azure Marketplace Logo Guidelines**

All the logos uploaded in the Publishing Portal should follow the below guidelines:

* The Azure design has a simple color palette. Keep the number of primary and secondary colors on your logo low.
* The theme colors of the Azure portal are white and black. Hence avoid using these colors as the background color of your logos. Use some color that would make your logos prominent in the Azure portal. We recommend simple primary colors. **If you are using transparent background, then make sure that the logos/text are not white or black.**
* Do not use a gradient background on the logo.
* Avoid placing text, even your company or brand name, on the logo. The look and feel of your logo should be 'flat' and should avoid gradients.
* The logo should not be stretched.
* Small logo should be of size 40 X 40 px
* Medium logo should be of size 90 X 90 px
* Large logo should be of size 115 X 115 px
* Wide logo should be of size 255 X 115 px
* Hero logo should be of size 815 X 290 px

> [!NOTE]
> The Hero logo is optional. The publisher can choose not to upload a Hero logo. However once uploaded the hero icon cannot be deleted from the Publishing portal. At that time, the partner must follow the Azure Marketplace guidelines for Hero icons.
> 
>

**Additional guidelines for the Hero logo icon (optional)**

* The Hero logo is optional. The publisher can choose not to upload a Hero logo. **However once uploaded the hero icon cannot be deleted from the Publishing portal. At that time, the partner must follow the Azure Marketplace guidelines for Hero icons else the offer will not be approved to production.**
* The Publisher Display Name, plan title and the offer long summary are displayed in white font color. Hence you should avoid keeping any light color in the background of the Hero Icon. Black, white and transparent background is not allowed for Hero icons.
* The publisher display name, plan title, the offer long summary and the create button are embedded programmatically inside the Hero logo once the offer goes listed. So you should not enter any text while you are designing the Hero logo. Just leave empty space on the right because the text (i.e. publisher display name, plan title, the offer long summary) will be included programmatically by us over there. The empty space for the text should be 415x100 on the right (and it is offset by 370px from the left).

### Links
On the **Links** tab on the left bar, enter any links with information that may help customers. Enter a name and URL for each link.

![drawing](media/marketplace-publishing-push-to-staging/pubportal-marketingcontent-link-01.png)

### Sample images (optional)
> [!NOTE]
> Including a sample image is an optional step.
> Even though you can upload multiple sample images in the Publishing portal, only one image (randomly selected by the system) gets displayed in the Azure portal. For this reason, we recommend uploading at most one sample image.
> 
> 

On the **Sample Images** tab on the left menu, upload a new image by clicking **Upload a new image**. If you have an existing image and you would like to replace it, click **Replace image**.

## Step 2: Set your prices
### Pricing models
| Pricing model | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Base |Flat monthly rate paid at time of purchase; e.g., $10/month. |
| Consumption (a.k.a. usage, meter) |Pay per use, which is defined by the publisher of the offer. Overage cannot be defined per seat, per user, etc., as there is no concept of a fraction of a user or capability to do proration. Usage is reported by the partner on an hourly basis. Customer pays at the of monthly billing cycle, as opposed to up front like monthly plans. |
| Free trial |Customer may use for free, for a limited time, and then pay normal rates thereafter. |
| Free tier |Plan is always free. |
| Migration (a.k.a. conversion or upgrade/downgrade) of plan |Concept of a user moving from their current plan to another acceptable plan; defined by partner. |

**Pricing models available by offer type**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Availability of certain pricing models vary by offer type. See the table below.
> 
> 

|  | Base only | Consumption only | Base + consumption |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Virtual machine image |No |Yes |No |
| Developer service |Yes |Yes |Yes |
| Data service |Yes |No |No |

### 2.1. Set your VM prices
Presently for virtual machines, we have the following **3 types of billing models:**

* **Hourly:** Customers get charged on a per-hour basis based on the rates set by the publishers on the VM sizes. In case of **hourly billing** model of the SKUs, the total price will be the summation of the software cost charged by the publisher and the infrastructure cost charged by Microsoft. This total cost will be displayed to the customer as an hourly and monthly price when they are considering the purchase (see the screenshot below). **Publisher receives 80% of the software cost charged by them.** Hence please make the calculation accordingly before setting prices for your SKUs.
  
    ![drawing](media/marketplace-publishing-push-to-staging/img2.1-01.png)
* **Free Trial:** This is another flavor of the Hourly model. Here the customer doesn’t get charged for software cost for the first 30 days(Free) after deploying the VM. After 30days they get charged on a per-hour basis based on the rates set by the publishers in the hourly model.
* **Bring-Your-Own-License (BYOL):** The publishers manage the licensing of the software running on the VM.

**Important:** Once the offer/SKU is listed in the Azure Marketplace, you cannot change the fields given below.

* **Pricing Change of listed SKU(s)**
* **Billing Model Change of listed SKU(s)**
* **Removal of billing regions of listed SKU(s)**
* **Changing the data disk count of listed SKU(s)**
* **Offer Identifier:** [Publishing portal -> Virtual Machines -> select your Offer -> VM Images -> Offer Identifier]
* **SKU Identifier:** [Publishing portal -> Virtual Machines -> Select your Offer -> SKUs tab -> Add a SKU]
* **Publisher Namespace:** [Publishing portal -> Virtual Machines -> Walkthrough tab -> Tell Us About Your Company (Found Under Step 2 Register) Publisher Namespace -> Namespace]
* **Ports:** [Publishing portal -> Virtual Machines -> your Offer -> VM Images tab -> Open Ports]

### “Sell-to” countries of the SKU
You need to carefully consider where you make your SKUs available. Some countries are classified as “Microsoft remit” and others are classified as “ISV remit.”

* In “Microsoft remit” countries, Microsoft collects taxes from customers and pays (remits) taxes to the government.
* In “ISV remit” countries, partners are responsible for collecting taxes customers and paying taxes to the government. If you choose to sell in “ISV remit” countries, you must have the capability to calculate and pay taxes in the countries you select.

> [!NOTE]
> Your SKU will not be available in the countries unless you set their pricing in the [Publishing portal](https://publish.windowsazure.com). Guidance to get set the pricing of Hourly and BYOL SKUs is given below.
