# How to perform live streaming with on-premise encoders using the Azure portal
This tutorial walks you through the steps of using the Azure portal to create a **Channel** that is configured for a pass-through delivery. 

Azure Media Services in the Azure portal is currently in preview.   

## Prerequisites
The following are required to complete the tutorial:

* An Azure account. For details, see [Azure Free Trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/). 
* A Media Services account.    To create a Media Services account, see [How to Create a Media Services Account](media-services-create-account.md).
* A webcam. For example, [Telestream Wirecast encoder](http://www.telestream.net/wirecast/overview.htm).

It is highly recommended to review the following articles:

* [Azure Media Services RTMP Support and Live Encoders](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/2014/09/18/azure-media-services-rtmp-support-and-live-encoders/)
* [Overview of Live Steaming using Azure Media Services](media-services-manage-channels-overview.md)
* [Live streaming with on-premise encoders that create multi-bitrate streams](media-services-live-streaming-with-onprem-encoders.md)

## <a id="scenario"></a>Common live streaming scenario
The following steps describe tasks involved in creating common live streaming applications that use channels that are configured for pass-through delivery. This tutorial shows how to create and manage a pass-through channel and live events.

1. Connect a video camera to a computer. Launch and configure an on-premises live encoder that outputs a multi-bitrate RTMP or Fragmented MP4 stream. For more information, see [Azure Media Services RTMP Support and Live Encoders](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=532824).
   
    This step could also be performed after you create your Channel.
2. Create and start a pass-through Channel.
3. Retrieve the Channel ingest URL. 
   
    The ingest URL is used by the live encoder to send the stream to the Channel.
4. Retrieve the Channel preview URL. 
   
    Use this URL to verify that your channel is properly receiving the live stream.
5. Create a live event/program. 
   
    When using the Azure portal, creating a live event also creates an asset. 
   
   > [!NOTE]
   > Make sure to have at least one streaming reserved unit on the streaming endpoint from which you want to stream content.
6. Start the event/program when you are ready to start streaming and archiving.
7. Optionally, the live encoder can be signaled to start an advertisement. The advertisement is inserted in the output stream.
8. Stop the event/program whenever you want to stop streaming and archiving the event.
9. Delete the event/program (and optionally delete the asset).     

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please review [Live streaming with on-premise encoders that create multi-bitrate streams](media-services-live-streaming-with-onprem-encoders.md) to learn about concepts and considerations related to live streaming with on-premise encoders and pass-through channels.

## Configure streaming endpoints
Media Services provides dynamic packaging which allows you to deliver your multi-bitrate MP4s in the following streaming formats: MPEG DASH, HLS, Smooth Streaming, or HDS, without you having to re-package into these streaming formats. With dynamic packaging you only need to store and pay for the files in single storage format and Media Services will build and serve the appropriate response based on requests from a client.

To take advantage of dynamic packaging, you need to get at least one streaming unit for the streaming endpoint from which you plan to delivery your content.  

To create and change the number of streaming reserved units, do the following:

1. In the **Settings** window, click **Streaming endpoints**. 
2. Click on the default streaming endpoint. 
   
    The **DEFAULT STREAMING ENDPOINT DETAILS** window appears.
3. To specify the number of streaming units, slide the **Streaming units** slider.
   
    ![Streaming units](./media/media-services-portal-vod-get-started/media-services-streaming-units.png)
4. Click the **Save** button to save your changes.
   
   > [!NOTE]
   > The allocation of any new units can take up to 20 minutes to complete.
   > 
   > 

## Create and start pass-through channels and events
A channel is associated with events/programs that enable you to control the publishing and storage of segments in a live stream. Channels manage events. 

You can specify the number of hours you want to retain the recorded content for the program by setting the **Archive Window** length. This value can be set from a minimum of 5 minutes to a maximum of 25 hours. Archive window length also dictates the maximum amount of time clients can seek back in time from the current live position. Events can run over the specified amount of time, but content that falls behind the window length is continuously discarded. This value of this property also determines how long the client manifests can grow.

Each event is associated with an asset. To publish the event you must create an OnDemand locator for the associated asset. Having this locator will enable you to build a streaming URL that you can provide to your clients.

A channel supports up to three concurrently running events so you can create multiple archives of the same incoming stream. This allows you to publish and archive different parts of an event as needed. For example, your business requirement is to archive 6 hours of a program, but to broadcast only last 10 minutes. To accomplish this, you need to create two concurrently running programs. One program is set to archive 6 hours of the event but the program is not published. The other program is set to archive for 10 minutes and this program is published.

You should not reuse existing live events. Instead, create and start a new event for each event.

Start the event when you are ready to start streaming and archiving. Stop the program whenever you want to stop streaming and archiving the event. 

To delete archived content, stop and delete the event and then delete the associated asset. An asset cannot be deleted if it is used by an event; the event must be deleted first. 

Even after you stop and delete the event, the users would be able to stream your archived content as a video on demand, for as long as you do not delete the asset.

If you do want to retain the archived content, but not have it available for streaming, delete the streaming locator.

### To use the portal to create a channel
This sections shows how to use the **Quick Create** option to create a pass-through channel.

For more details about pass-through channels, see [Live streaming with on-premise encoders that create multi-bitrate streams](media-services-live-streaming-with-onprem-encoders.md).

1. In the **Settings** window, click **Live streaming**. 
   
    ![Getting started](./media/media-services-portal-passthrough-get-started/media-services-getting-started.png)
   
    The **Live streaming** window appears.
2. Click **Quick Create** to create a pass-through channel with the RTMP ingest protocol.
   
    The **CREATE A NEW CHANNEL** window appears.
3. Give the new channel a name and click **Create**. 
   
    This will create a pass-through channel with the RTMP ingest protocol.
   
    The channel also adds, starts and publishes a default live event/program. This event is configured to have 8 hours of archive window. 
   
    To add more events, press **Live Event** button.

## Get ingest URLs
Once the channel is created, you can get ingest URLs that you will provide to the live encoder. The encoder uses these URLs to input a live stream.

## Watch an event
To watch the event, click **Watch** in the Azure portal or copy the streaming URL and use a player of your choice.

Live event will automatically convert to on-demand content when stopped.

## Clean up
For more details about pass-through channels, see [Live streaming with on-premise encoders that create multi-bitrate streams](media-services-live-streaming-with-onprem-encoders.md).

* A channel can be stopped only when all events/programs on the channel have been stopped.  Once the Channel is stopped, it will not incur any charges. When you need to start it again, it will have the same ingest URL so you won't need to reconfigure your encoder.
* A channel can be deleted only when all live events on the channel have been deleted.

## View archived content
Even after you stop and delete the event, the users would be able to stream your archived content as a video on demand, for as long as you do not delete the asset. An asset cannot be deleted if it is used by an event; the event must be deleted first. 

To manage your assets select **Setting** and click **Assets**.
