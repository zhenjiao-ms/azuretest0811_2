## Overview
In Media Services a media processor is a component that handles a specific processing task, such as encoding, format conversion, encrypting, or decrypting media content. You typically create a media processor when you are creating a task to encode, encrypt, or convert the format of media content.

The following table provides the name and description of each available media processor.

| Media Processor Name | Description | More Information |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Media Encoder Standard |Provides standard capabilities for on-demand encoding. |[Overview and Comparison of Azure On Demand Media Encoders](media-services-encode-asset.md) |
| Media Encoder Premium Workflow |Lets you run encoding tasks using Media Encoder Premium Workflow. |[Overview and Comparison of Azure On Demand Media Encoders](media-services-encode-asset.md) |
| Azure Media Indexer |Enables you to make media files and content searchable, as well as generate closed captioning tracks and keywords. |[Azure Media Indexer](media-services-index-content.md) |
| Azure Media Hyperlapse (preview) |Enables you to smooth out the "bumps" in your video with video stabilization. Also allows you to speed up your content into a consumable clip. |[Azure Media Hyperlapse](media-services-hyperlapse-content.md) |

## Get MediaProcessor
> [!NOTE]
> When working with the Media Services REST API, the following considerations apply:
> 
> When accessing entities in Media Services, you must set specific header fields and values in your HTTP requests. For more information, see [Setup for Media Services REST API Development](media-services-rest-how-to-use.md).
> 
> After successfully connecting to https://media.windows.net, you will receive a 301 redirect specifying another Media Services URI. You must make subsequent calls to the new URI as described in [Connecting to Media Services using REST API](media-services-rest-connect-programmatically.md).

The following REST call shows how to get a media processor instance by name (in this case, **Media Encoder Standard**). 

Request:

    GET https://media.windows.net/api/MediaProcessors()?$filter=Name%20eq%20'Media%20Encoder%20Standard' HTTP/1.1
    DataServiceVersion: 1.0;NetFx
    MaxDataServiceVersion: 3.0;NetFx
    Accept: application/json
    Accept-Charset: UTF-8
    User-Agent: Microsoft ADO.NET Data Services
    Authorization: Bearer <token>
    x-ms-version: 2.11
    Host: media.windows.net

Response:

    . . .

    {  
       "odata.metadata":"https://media.windows.net/api/$metadata#MediaProcessors",
       "value":[  
          {  
             "Id":"nb:mpid:UUID:ff4df607-d419-42f0-bc17-a481b1331e56",
             "Description":"Media Encoder Standard",
