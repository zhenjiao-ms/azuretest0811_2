# Using partners to deliver Widevine licenses to Azure Media Services
## Overview
Microsoft Azure Media Services enables you to deliver MPEG-DASH protected with Widevine DRM, which is encrypted per the Common Encryption (CENC) specification.

Starting with the Media Services .NET SDK version 3.5.2, Media Services enables you to configure Widevine license template and get Widevine licenses. You can also use the following AMS partners to help you deliver Widevine licenses: [Axinom](http://www.axinom.com/press/ibc-axinom-drm-6/), [EZDRM](http://ezdrm.com/), [castLabs](http://castlabs.com/company/partners/azure/).

## castLabs
You can use [castLabs](http://castlabs.com/company/partners/azure/) to deliver Widevine licenses. For more information, see [Using castLabs to deliver DRM licenses to Azure Media Services](media-services-castlabs-integration.md)

## Axinom
You can use [Axinom](http://www.axinom.com/press/ibc-axinom-drm-6/) to deliver Widevine licenses. For more information, see [Using Axinom to deliver DRM licenses to Azure Media Services](media-services-axinom-integration.md)
