## Overview
In Media Services a media processor is a component that handles a specific processing task, such as encoding, format conversion, encrypting, or decrypting media content. You typically create a media processor when you are creating a task to encode, encrypt, or convert the format of media content.

The following table provides the name and description of each available media processor.

| Media Processor Name | Description | More Information |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Media Encoder Standard |Provides standard capabilities for on-demand encoding. |[Overview and Comparison of Azure On Demand Media Encoders](media-services-encode-asset.md) |
| Media Encoder Premium Workflow |Lets you run encoding tasks using Media Encoder Premium Workflow. |[Overview and Comparison of Azure On Demand Media Encoders](media-services-encode-asset.md) |
| Azure Media Indexer |Enables you to make media files and content searchable, as well as generate closed captioning tracks and keywords. |[Azure Media Indexer](media-services-index-content.md) |
| Azure Media Hyperlapse (preview) |Enables you to smooth out the "bumps" in your video with video stabilization. Also allows you to speed up your content into a consumable clip. |[Azure Media Hyperlapse](media-services-hyperlapse-content.md) |

## Get Media Processor
The following method shows how to get a media processor instance. The code example assumes the use of a module-level variable named **_context** to reference the server context as described in the section [How to: Connect to Media Services Programmatically](media-services-dotnet-connect-programmatically.md).

    private static IMediaProcessor GetLatestMediaProcessorByName(string mediaProcessorName)
    {
        var processor = _context.MediaProcessors.Where(p => p.Name == mediaProcessorName).
        ToList().OrderBy(p => new Version(p.Version)).LastOrDefault();

        if (processor == null)
        throw new ArgumentException(string.Format("Unknown media processor", mediaProcessorName));

        return processor;
    }
