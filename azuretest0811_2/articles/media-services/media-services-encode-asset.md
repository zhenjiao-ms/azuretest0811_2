# Overview and Comparison of Azure On Demand Media Encoders
## Encoding overview
Azure Media Services provides multiple options for the encoding of media in the cloud.

When starting out with Media Services, it is important to understand the difference between codecs and file formats.
Codecs are the software that implements the compression/decompression algorithms whereas file formats are containers that hold the compressed video.

Media Services provides dynamic packaging which allows you to deliver your adaptive bitrate MP4 or Smooth Streaming encoded content in streaming formats supported by Media Services (MPEG DASH, HLS, Smooth Streaming, HDS) without you having to re-package into these streaming formats.

To take advantage of [dynamic packaging](media-services-dynamic-packaging-overview.md), you need to do the following:

* Encode your mezzanine (source) file into a set of adaptive bitrate MP4 files or adaptive bitrate Smooth Streaming files (the encoding steps are demonstrated later in this tutorial).
* Get at least one On-Demand streaming unit for the streaming endpoint from which you plan to delivery your content. For more information, see [How to Scale On-Demand Streaming Reserved Units](media-services-manage-origins.md#scale_streaming_endpoints/).

Media Services supports the following on demand encoders that are described in this article:

* [Media Encoder Standard](media-services-encode-asset.md#media-encoder-standard)
* [Media Encoder Premium Workflow](media-services-encode-asset.md#media-encoder-premium-workflow)

This article gives a brief overview of on demand media encoders and provides links to articles that give more detailed information. The topic also provides comparison of the encoders.

Note that by default each Media Services account can have one active encoding task at a time. You can reserve encoding units that allow you to have multiple encoding tasks running concurrently, one for each encoding reserved unit you purchase. For information, see [Scaling encoding units](media-services-portal-encoding-units.md).

## Media Encoder Standard

### Generate thumbnails
For information, see [How to generate thumbnails using Media Encoder Standard](media-services-custom-mes-presets-with-dotnet.md#thumbnails).

### Trim videos (clipping)
For information, see [How to trim videos using Media Encoder Standard](media-services-custom-mes-presets-with-dotnet.md#trim_video).

## Media Encoder Premium Workflow
### Overview
[Introducing Premium Encoding in Azure Media Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/2015/03/05/introducing-premium-encoding-in-azure-media-services/)

### How to use
Media Encoder Premium Workflow is configured using complex workflows. Workflow files could be created and updated using the [Workflow Designer](media-services-workflow-designer.md) tool.

[How to Use Premium Encoding in Azure Media Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/2015/03/06/how-to-use-premium-encoding-in-azure-media-services/)

### Known issues
If your input video does not contain closed captioning, the output Asset will still contain an empty TTML file.

## Error codes
The following table lists error codes that could be returned in case an error was encountered during the encoding task execution.  To get error details in your .NET code, use the [ErrorDetails](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.windowsazure.mediaservices.client.errordetail.aspx) class. To get error details in your REST code, use the [ErrorDetail](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/jj853026.aspx) REST API.

| ErrorDetail.Code | Possible causes for error |
| --- | --- |
| Unknown |Unknown error while executing the task |
| ErrorDownloadingInputAssetMalformedContent |Category of errors that covers errors in downloading input asset such as bad file names, zero length files, incorrect formats and so on. |
| ErrorDownloadingInputAssetServiceFailure |Category of errors that covers problems on the service side - for example network or storage errors while downloading. |
| ErrorParsingConfiguration |Category of errors where task <see cref="MediaTask.PrivateData"/> (configuration) is not valid, for example the configuration is not a valid system preset or it contains invalid XML. |
| ErrorExecutingTaskMalformedContent |Category of errors during the execution of the task where issues inside the input media files cause failure. |
| ErrorExecutingTaskUnsupportedFormat |Category of errors where the media processor cannot process the files provided - media format not supported, or does not match the Configuration. For example, trying to produce an audio-only output from an asset that has only video |
| ErrorProcessingTask |Category of other errors that the media processor encounters during the processing of the task that are unrelated to content. |
| ErrorUploadingOutputAsset |Category of errors when uploading the output asset |
| ErrorCancelingTask |Category of errors to cover failures when attempting to cancel the Task |
| TransientError |Category of errors to cover transient issues (eg. temporary networking issues with Azure Storage) |
