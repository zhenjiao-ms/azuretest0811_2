# Azure Media Services Release Notes
These release notes summarize changes from previous releases and known issues.

> [!NOTE]

## <a id="issues"></a>Currently Known Issues
### <a id="general_issues"></a>Media Services General Issues
| Issue | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Several common HTTP headers are not provided in the REST API. |If you develop Media Services applications using the REST API, you find that some common HTTP header fields (including CLIENT-REQUEST-ID, REQUEST-ID, and RETURN-CLIENT-REQUEST-ID) are not supported. The headers will be added in a future update. |
| Encoding an asset with a file name that contains escape characters (for example, %20) fails with “MediaProcessor : File not found.” |Names of files that are going to be added to an asset and then encoded should only contain alphanumeric characters and spaces. The issue will be fixed in a future update. |
| The ListBlobs method that is part of the Azure Storage SDK version 3.x fails. |Media Services generates SAS URLs based on the [2012-02-12](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn592123.aspx) version. If you want to use Azure Storage SDK to list blobs in a blob container, use the [CloudBlobContainer.ListBlobs](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.windowsazure.storage.blob.cloudblobcontainer.listblobs.aspx) method that is part of Azure Storage SDK version 2.x. The ListBlobs method that is part of the Azure Storage SDK version 3.x will fail. |
| Media Services throttling mechanism restricts the resource usage for applications that make excessive request to the service. The service may return the Service Unavailable (503) HTTP status code. |For more information, see the description of the 503 HTTP status code in the [Azure Media Services Error Codes](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn168949.aspx) topic. |
| When querying entities, there is a limit of 1000 entities returned at one time because public REST v2 limits query results to 1000 results. |You need to use **Skip** and **Take** (.NET)/ **top** (REST) as described in [this .NET example](media-services-dotnet-manage-entities.md#enumerating-through-large-collections-of-entities) and [this REST API example](media-services-rest-manage-entities.md#enumerating-through-large-collections-of-entities).  |
| Some clients can come across a repeat tag issue in the Smooth Streaming manifest. |For more information, see [this](media-services-deliver-content-overview.md#known-issues) section. |
| Azure Media Services .NET SDK objects cannot be serialized and as a result do not work with Azure Caching. |If you try to serialize the SDK AssetCollection object to add it to Azure Caching, an exception is thrown. |

## <a id="rest_version_history"></a>REST API Version History
For information about the Media Services REST API version history, see [Azure Media Services REST API Reference](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/hh973617.aspx).

## <a id="july_changes16"></a>July 2016 Release
### Updates to manifest file (*.ISM) generated by encoding tasks
When an encoding task is submitted to Media Encoder Standard or Azure Media Encoder, the encoding task generates a [streaming manifest file](media-services-deliver-content-overview.md) (*.ism) file in the output Asset. With the latest service release, the syntax of this streaming manifest file has been updated.

> [!NOTE]
> The syntax of the streaming manifest (.ism) file is reserved for internal use, and is subject to change in future releases. Please do not modify or manipulate the contents of this file.
> 
> 

### A new client manifest (*.ISMC) file is generated in the output Asset when an encoding task outputs one or more MP4 files
Starting with the latest service release, after the completion of an encoding task that generates one more MP4 files, the output Asset will also contain a streaming client manifest (*.ismc) file. The .ismc file helps improve the performance of dynamic streaming. 

> [!NOTE]
> The syntax of the client manifest (.ismc) file is reserved for internal use, and is subject to change in future releases. Please do not modify or manipulate the contents of this file.
> 
> 

For more information, see [this](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/randomnumber/2016/07/08/encoder-changes-within-azure-media-services-now-create-ismc-file/) blog.

### Known issues
Some clients can come aross a repeat tag issue in the Smooth Streaming manifest. For more information, see [this](media-services-deliver-content-overview.md#known-issues) section.

## <a id="apr_changes16"></a>April 2016 Release
### Azure Media Analytics
Azure Media Servces introduced Azure Media Analytics for powerful video intelligence. For detailed information, see [Azure Media Services Analytics Overview](media-services-analytics-overview.md).

### Apple FairPlay (Preview)
Azure Media Services now enables you to dynamically encrypt your HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) content with  Apple FairPlay. You can also use AMS license delivery service to deliver FairPlay licenses to clients. For more detailed information, see [Use Azure Media Services to Stream your HLS content Protected with Apple FairPlay ](media-services-protect-hls-with-fairplay.md).

## <a id="feb_changes16"></a>February 2016 Release
The latest version of Azure Media Services SDK for .NET (3.5.3) contains a Widevine related bug fix. The problem was:  AssetDeliveryPolicy couldn't be reused for multiple assets encrypted with Widevine. As part of this bug fix the following property was added to the SDK: **WidevineBaseLicenseAcquisitionUrl**.

    Dictionary<AssetDeliveryPolicyConfigurationKey, string> assetDeliveryPolicyConfiguration =
        new Dictionary<AssetDeliveryPolicyConfigurationKey, string>
    {
        {AssetDeliveryPolicyConfigurationKey.WidevineBaseLicenseAcquisitionUrl,"http://testurl"},

    };

## <a id="jan_changes_16"></a>January 2016 Release
Encoding Reserved Units renamed to reduce confusion with Encoder names.

The Basic, Standard, and Premium encoding reserved units are renamed to S1, S2, and S3  reserved units, respectively.  Customers using Basic Encoding RUs today will see S1 as the label in Azure Portal (and in the bill), while Standard and Premium will see the labels S2 and S3 respectively. 

## <a id="dec_changes_15"></a>December 2015 Release
The Azure SDK team published a new release of the [Azure SDK for PHP](http://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-php) package that contains updates and new features for Microsoft Azure Media Services.

## <a id="december_changes_14"></a>December 2014 Release
### General Media Services Updates
* Some updates and new features were added to the Azure Indexer Media processor. For more information, see [Azure Media Indexer Version 1.1.6.7 Release Notes](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/2014/12/03/azure-media-indexer-version-1-1-6-7-release-notes/).
* Added a new REST API that enables you to update encoding reserved units: [EncodingReservedUnitType with REST](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn859236.aspx).
* Added CORS support for key delivery service.
* Performance improvements of querying authorization policy options were done.
* In China data center, the [Key Delivery URL](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/ef4dfeeb-48ae-4596-ab28-44d6b36d8769#get_delivery_service_url) is now per customer (just like in other data centers).
* Added HLS auto target duration. When doing live streaming, HLS is always packaged dynamically. By default, Media Services automatically calculates HLS segment packaging ratio (FragmentsPerSegment) based on the keyframe interval (KeyFrameInterval ), also referred to as Group of Pictures – GOP, that is received from the Live encoder. For more information, see [Working with Azure Media Services Live Streaming](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn783466.aspx).

### Media Services .NET SDK Updates
* [Azure Media Services .NET SDK](http://www.nuget.org/packages/windowsazure.mediaservices/) is now version 3.1.0.0.
* Upgraded the .Net SDK dependency to .NET 4.5 Framework.
* Added a new API that enables you to update encoding reserved units. For more information, see [Updating Reserved Unit Type and Increasing Encoding RUs using .NET](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/jj129582.aspx).
* Added JWT (JSON Web Token) support for token authentication. For more information, see [JWT token Authentication in Azure Media Services and Dynamic Encryption](http://www.gtrifonov.com/2015/01/03/jwt-token-authentication-in-azure-media-services-and-dynamic-encryption/).
* Added relative offsets for BeginDate and ExpirationDate in the PlayReady license template.

## <a id="november_changes_14"></a>November 2014 Release
* Media Services now enables you to ingest a live Smooth Streaming (FMP4) content over an SSL connection. To ingest over SSL, make sure to update the ingest URL to HTTPS.  For more information about live streaming, see [Working with Azure Media Services Live Streaming](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn783466.aspx).
* Note that currently, you cannot ingest an RTMP live stream over an SSL connection.
* You can also stream your content over an SSL connection. To do this, make sure your streaming URLs start with HTTPS.
* Note that you can only stream over SSL if the streaming endpoint from which you deliver your content was created after September 10th, 2014. If your streaming URLs are based on the streaming endpoints created after September 10th, the URL contains “streaming.mediaservices.windows.net” (the new format). Streaming URLs that contain “origin.mediaservices.windows.net” (the old format) do not support SSL. If your URL is in the old format and you want to be able to stream over SSL, [create a new streaming endpoint](media-services-manage-origins.md). Use URLs created based on the new streaming endpoint to stream your content over SSL.

## <a id="october_changes_14"></a>October 2014 Release
### <a id="new_encoder_release"></a>Media Services Encoder Release
Announcing the new release of Media Services Azure Media Encoder. With the latest Azure Media Encoder you are only charged for output GBs, but otherwise the new encoder is feature compatible with the previous encoder. For more information [Media Services Pricing Details](http://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/media-services/)).

### <a id="oct_sdk"></a>Media Services .NET SDK
Media Services SDK for .NET Extensions is now version 2.0.0.3.

Media Services SDK for .NET is now version 3.0.0.8.

The following changes were made:

* Refactoring in retry policy classes.
* Adding user agent string to http request headers.
* Adding nuget restore build step.
* Fixing scenario tests to use x509 cert from repository.
* Validating settings when updating channel and streaming end.

### New GitHub repository to host Media Services samples
Samples are located in [Azure Media Services samples GitHub repository](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Media-Services-Samples).

## <a id="september_changes_14"></a>September 2014 Release
Media Services REST metadata is now version 2.7. For more information about the latest REST updates, see [Azure Media Services REST API Reference](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/hh973617.aspx).

Media Services SDK for .NET is now version 3.0.0.7

### <a id="sept_14_breaking_changes"></a>Breaking Changes
* **Origin** was renamed to [StreamingEndpoint](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn783468.aspx).
* A change in the default behavior when using the **Azure Classic Portal** to encode and then publish MP4 files.

Previously, when using the Azure Classic Portal to publish a single-file MP4 video asset a SAS URL would be created (SAS URLs allow you to download the video from a blob storage). Currently, when you use the Azure Classic Portal to encode and then publish a single-file MP4 video asset, the generated URL points to an Azure Media Services streaming endpoint.  This change does not affect MP4 videos that are directly uploaded to Media Services and published without being encoded by Azure Media Services.

Currently, you have the following two options to solve the problem.

* Enable streaming units and use dynamic packaging to stream the .mp4 asset as a smooth streaming presentation.
* Create a SAS url to download (or progressively play) the .mp4. For more information about how to create a SAS locator, see [Delivering Content](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/hh973618.aspx).

### <a id="sept_14_GA_changes"></a>New features/scenarios that are part of GA release
* **Indexer Media Processor**. For more information see [Indexing Media Files with Azure Media Indexer](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn783455.aspx).
* The [StreamingEndpoint](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn783468.aspx) entity now enables you to add custom domain (host) names.
  
    For a custom domain name to be used as the Media Services streaming endpoint name, you need to add custom host names to your streaming endpoint. Use the Media Services REST APIs or .NET SDK to add custom host names.
  
    The following considerations apply:
  
  * You must have the ownership of the custom domain name.
  * The ownership of the domain name must be validated by Azure Media Services. To validate the domain, create a CName that maps <MediaServicesAccountId>.<parent domain> to verifydns.<mediaservices-dns-zone>. 
  * You must create another CName  that maps the custom host name (for example,  sports.contoso.com) to your Media Services StreamingEndpont’s host name (for example,  amstest.streaming.mediaservices.windows.net).

    For more information, see the **CustomHostNames** property in the [StreamingEndpoint] topic.

### <a id="sept_14_preview_changes"></a>New features/scenarios that are part of the public preview release
* Live Streaming Preview. For more information, see [Working with Azure Media Services Live Streaming](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn783466.aspx).
* Key Delivery Service. For more information, see [Using AES-128 Dynamic Encryption and Key Delivery Service](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn783457.aspx).
* AES Dynamic Encryption. For more information, see [Using AES-128 Dynamic Encryption and Key Delivery Service](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn783457.aspx).
* PlayReady License Delivery Service. For more information, see [Using PlayReady Dynamic Encryption and License Delivery Service](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn783467.aspx).
* PlayReady Dynamic Encryption. For more information, see [Using PlayReady Dynamic Encryption and License Delivery Service](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn783467.aspx).
* Media Services PlayReady License Template. For more information, see [Media Services PlayReady License Template Overview](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn783459.aspx).
* Streaming storage encrypted assets. For more information, see [Streaming Storage Encrypted Content](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn783451.aspx).

## <a id="august_changes_14"></a>August 2014 Release
When you encode an asset, an output asset is produced upon completion of the encoding job. Until this release, Azure Media Services Encoder produced metadata about output assets. Starting with this release the encoder also produces metadata about input assets. For more information, see the [Input Metadata](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn783120.aspx) and [Output Metadata](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn783217.aspx) topics.

## <a id="july_changes_14"></a>July 2014 Release
The following bug fixes were made for the Azure Media Services Packager and Encryptor:

* Only audio plays back when transmuxing a live archive asset to HTTP Live Streaming – this has been fixed and now both audio and video are played.
* When packaging an asset to HTTP Live Streaming and AES 128-bit envelope encryption, the packaged streams do not play back on Android devices – this bug has been fixed and the packaged stream plays back on Android devices that support HTTP Live Streaming.

## <a id="may_changes_14"></a>May 2014 Release
### <a id="may_14_changes"></a>General Media Services Updates
You can now use [Dynamic Packaging](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/jj889436.aspx) to stream HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) v3. To stream HLS v3, add the following format to the origin locator path: * .ism/manifest(format=m3u8-aapl-v3). For more information, see [Nick Drouin's Blog](http://blog-ndrouin.azurewebsites.net/hls-v3-new-old-thing/).

Dynamic Packaging now also supports delivering HLS (v3 and v4) encrypted with PlayReady based on Smooth Streaming statically encrypted with PlayReady. For information on how to encrypt Smooth Streaming with PlayReady, see [Protecting Smooth Stream with PlayReady](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn189154.aspx).

### <a name="may_14_donnet_changes"></a>Media Services .NET SDK Updates
The following improvements are included in the Media Services .NET SDK 3.0.0.5 release:

* Better speed and resilience for uploading/downloading media assets.
* Improvements in retry logic and transient exception handling: 
  
  * Transient error detection and retry logic were improved for exceptions that are caused by querying, saving changes, uploading or downloading files. 
  * When getting Web Exceptions (for example, during an ACS token request), you will notice that fatal errors are failing faster now.

For more information, see [Retry Logic in the Media Services SDK for .NET](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn745650.aspx).

## <a id="december_changes_12"></a>December 2012 Release
### <a name="dec_12_dotnet_changes"></a>Azure Media Services .NET SDK changes
* Intellisense : Added missing Intellisense documentation for many types.
* Microsoft.Practices.TransientFaultHandling.Core : Fixed an issue where the SDK still had a dependency to an old version of this assembly. The SDK now references version 5.1.1209.1 of this assembly.

Fixes for issues found in the November 2012 SDK:

* IAsset.Locators.Count : This count is now correctly reported on new IAsset interfaces after all locators have been deleted.
* IAssetFile.ContentFileSize : This value is now properly set after an upload by IAssetFile.Upload(filepath).
* IAssetFile.ContentFileSize : This property can now be set when creating an asset file. It was previously read-only.
* IAssetFile.Upload(filepath) : Fixed an issue where this synchronous upload method was throwing the following error when uploading multiple files to the asset. The error was "Server failed to authenticate the request. Make sure the value of Authorization header is formed correctly including the signature."
* IAssetFile.UploadAsync : Fixed an issue where no more than 5 files could be uploaded simultaneously.
* IAssetFile.UploadProgressChanged : This event is now provided by the SDK.
* IAssetFile.DownloadAsync(string, BlobTransferClient, ILocator, CancellationToken): This method overload is now provided.
* IAssetFile.DownloadAsync : Fixed an issue where no more than 5 files could be downloaded simultaneously.
* IAssetFile.Delete() : Fixed an issue where calling delete may throw an exception if no file was uploaded for the IAssetFile.
* Jobs : Fixed an issue where chaining a "MP4 to Smooth Streams task" with a "PlayReady Protection Task" using a job template would not create any tasks at all.
* EncryptionUtils.GetCertificateFromStore() : This method no longer throws a null reference exception due to a failures finding the certificate based on certificate configuration issues.

## <a id="november_changes_12"></a>November 2012 Release
The changes mentioned in this section were updates included in the November 2012 (version 2.0.0.0) SDK. These changes may require any code written for the June 2012 preview SDK release to be modified or rewritten.

* Assets
  
    IAsset.Create(assetName) is the ONLY asset creation function. IAsset.Create no longer uploads files as part of the method call. Use IAssetFile for uploading.
  
    The IAsset.Publish method and the AssetState.Publish enumeration value have been removed from the Services SDK. Any code that relies on this value must be re-written.
* FileInfo
  
    This class has been removed and replaced by IAssetFile.
  
    IAssetFiles
  
    IAssetFile replaces FileInfo and has a different behavior. To use it, instantiate the IAssetFiles object, followed by a file upload either using the Media Services SDK or the Azure Storage SDK. The following IAssetFile.Upload overloads can be used:
  
  * IAssetFile.Upload(filePath): A synchronous method that blocks the thread and is recommended only when uploading a single file.
  * IAssetFile.UploadAsync(filePath, blobTransferClient, locator, cancellationToken): An asynchronous method. This is the preferred upload mechanism. 
    
    Known bug: using the cancellationToken will indeed cancel the upload; however, the cancellation state of the tasks can be any of a number of states. You must properly catch and handle exceptions.
* Locators
  
    The Origin-specific versions have been removed. The SAS-specific context.Locators.CreateSasLocator(asset, accessPolicy) will be marked deprecated, or removed by GA. See the Locators section under New Functionality for updated behavior.

## <a id="june_changes_12"></a>June 2012 Preview Release
The following functionality was new in the November release of the SDK.

* Deleting Entities
  
    IAsset, IAssetFile, ILocator, IAccessPolicy, IContentKey objects are now deleted at the object level, i.e. IObject.Delete(), instead of requiring a delete in the Collection, that is cloudMediaContext.ObjCollection.Delete(objInstance).
* Locators
  
    Locators must now be created using the CreateLocator method and use the LocatorType.SAS or LocatorType.OnDemandOrigin enum values as an argument for the specific type of locator you want to create.
  
    New properties were added to Locators to make it easier to obtain usable URIs for your content. This redesign of Locators was meant to provide more flexibility for future third-party extensibility and increase ease-of-use for media client applications.
* Asynchronous Method Support
  
    Asynchronous support has been added to all methods.
