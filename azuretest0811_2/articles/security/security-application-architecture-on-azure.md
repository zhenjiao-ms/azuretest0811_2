# Application architecture on Azure
In order to help secure your cloud-based solutions on Microsoft Azure, a strong architectural foundation is critical. Architects, designers, and implementers all benefit from a strong knowledge of application and services architecture. This foundational knowledge will help you understand all of the components of your cloud-based solutions and make it easier to integrate security into all aspects of your design and implementation.

We have the following to help you with your architectural investigations and designs:

* Architectural infographics
* Architectural blueprints
* Cloud and enterprise symbol set
* 3D blueprint Visio template

## Architectural infographics
Microsoft publishes several architectural related posters/infographics. They include:

* [Building Real-World Cloud Applications](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/infographics/building-real-world-cloud-apps/)
* [Scaling with Cloud Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/infographics/cloud-services/)

## Architectural blueprints
Microsoft publishes a set of high level [architectural blueprints](http://aka.ms/azblueprints) showing how to build specific types of systems using Microsoft products.
Each blueprint includes a:

* Flat 2D Visio 2003-based file that you can download and modify
* Colorful 3D perspective PDF file to introduce the blueprint to less technical audiences
* Video that walks through the 3D version

## Cloud and enterprise symbol set
[View the Visio and symbols training video](http://aka.ms/CnESymbolsVideo) and then [download the Cloud and Enterprise Symbol set](http://aka.ms/CnESymbols) to help create technical materials that describe Azure, Windows Server, SQL Server and more. You can use the symbols in architecture diagrams, training materials, presentations, datasheets, infographics, whitepapers and even 3rd party books if the book trains people to use Microsoft products. However, they are not meant for use in user interfaces.

## 3D blueprint Visio template
The 3D versions of the [Microsoft Architecture Blueprints](http://aka.ms/azblueprints) were initially created in a non-Microsoft tool. A new Visio 2013 (and later) template shipped on Aug 5, 2015 as part of a [Microsoft Architecture certification course distributed on EDX.ORG](../architecture-overview.md#microsoft-architecture-certification-course).

The template is also available outside the course.

* [View the training video](http://aka.ms/3dBlueprintTemplateVideo) first so you know what it can do
* Download the [Microsoft 3d Blueprint Visio Template](http://aka.ms/3DBlueprintTemplate)
* Download the [Cloud and Enterprise Symbols](../architecture-overview.md#drawing-symbol-and-icon-sets) to use with the 3D template
