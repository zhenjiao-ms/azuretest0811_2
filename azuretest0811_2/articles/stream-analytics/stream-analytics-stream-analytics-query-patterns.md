# Query examples for common Stream Analytics usage patterns
## Introduction
Queries in Azure Stream Analytics are expressed in a SQL-like query language, which is documented in the [Stream Analytics Query Language Reference](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn834998.aspx) guide.  This article outlines solutions to several common query patterns based on real world scenarios.  It is a work in progress and will continue to be updated with new patterns on an ongoing basis.

## Query example: Data type conversions
**Description**: Define the types of the properties on the input stream.
e.g. Car weight is coming on the input stream as strings and needs to be converted to INT to perform SUM it up.

**Input**:

| Make | Time | Weight |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Honda |2015-01-01T00:00:01.0000000Z |"1000" |
| Honda |2015-01-01T00:00:02.0000000Z |"2000" |

**Output**:

| Make | Weight |
| --- | --- |
| Honda |3000 |

**Solution**:

    SELECT
        Make,
        SUM(CAST(Weight AS BIGINT)) AS Weight
    FROM
        Input TIMESTAMP BY Time
    GROUP BY
        Make,
        TumblingWindow(second, 10)

**Explanation**:
Use a CAST statement on the Weight field to specify its type (see the list of supported Data Types [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn835065.aspx)).

## Query example: Using Like/Not like to do pattern matching
**Description**: Check that a field value on the event matches a certain pattern
e.g. Return license plates that start with A and end with 9

**Input**:

| Make | LicensePlate | Time |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Honda |ABC-123 |2015-01-01T00:00:01.0000000Z |
| Toyota |AAA-999 |2015-01-01T00:00:02.0000000Z |
| Nissan |ABC-369 |2015-01-01T00:00:03.0000000Z |

**Output**:

| Make | LicensePlate | Time |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Toyota |AAA-999 |2015-01-01T00:00:02.0000000Z |
| Nissan |ABC-369 |2015-01-01T00:00:03.0000000Z |

**Solution**:

    SELECT
        *
    FROM
        Input TIMESTAMP BY Time
    WHERE
        LicensePlate LIKE 'A%9'

**Explanation**:
Use the LIKE statement to check that the LicensePlate field value starts with A then has any string of zero or more characters and it ends with 9. 

## Query example: Specify logic for different cases/values (CASE statements)
**Description**: Provide different computation for a field based on some criteria.
e.g. Provide a string description for how many cars passed of the same make with a special case for 1.

**Input**:

| Make | Time |
| --- | --- |
| Honda |2015-01-01T00:00:01.0000000Z |
| Toyota |2015-01-01T00:00:02.0000000Z |
| Toyota |2015-01-01T00:00:03.0000000Z |

**Output**:

| CarsPassed | Time |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 Honda |2015-01-01T00:00:10.0000000Z |
| 2 Toyotas |2015-01-01T00:00:10.0000000Z |

**Solution**:

    SELECT
        CASE
            WHEN COUNT(*) = 1 THEN CONCAT('1 ', Make)
            ELSE CONCAT(CAST(COUNT(*) AS NVARCHAR(MAX)), ' ', Make, 's')
        END AS CarsPassed,
        System.TimeStamp AS Time
    FROM
        Input TIMESTAMP BY Time
    GROUP BY
        Make,
        TumblingWindow(second, 10)

**Explanation**:
The CASE clause allows us to provide a different computation based on some criteria (in our case the count of cars in the aggregate window).

## Query example: Send data to multiple outputs
**Description**: Send data to multiple output targets from a single job.
e.g. Analyze data for a threshold-based alert and archive all events to blob storage

**Input**:

| Make | Time |
| --- | --- |
| Honda |2015-01-01T00:00:01.0000000Z |
| Honda |2015-01-01T00:00:02.0000000Z |
| Toyota |2015-01-01T00:00:01.0000000Z |
| Toyota |2015-01-01T00:00:02.0000000Z |
| Toyota |2015-01-01T00:00:03.0000000Z |

**Output1**:

| Make | Time |
| --- | --- |
| Honda |2015-01-01T00:00:01.0000000Z |
| Honda |2015-01-01T00:00:02.0000000Z |
| Toyota |2015-01-01T00:00:01.0000000Z |
| Toyota |2015-01-01T00:00:02.0000000Z |
| Toyota |2015-01-01T00:00:03.0000000Z |

**Output2**:

| Make | Time | Count |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Toyota |2015-01-01T00:00:10.0000000Z |3 |

**Solution**:

    SELECT
        *
    INTO
        ArchiveOutput
    FROM
        Input TIMESTAMP BY Time

    SELECT
        Make,
        System.TimeStamp AS Time,
        COUNT(*) AS [Count]
    INTO
        AlertOutput
    FROM
        Input TIMESTAMP BY Time
    GROUP BY
        Make,
        TumblingWindow(second, 10)
    HAVING
        [Count] >= 3

**Explanation**:
The INTO clause tells Stream Analytics which of the outputs to write the data from this statement.
The first query is a pass-through of the data we received to an output that we named ArchiveOutput.
The second query does some simple aggregation and filtering and sends the results to a downstream alerting system.
*Note*: You can also reuse results of CTEs (i.e. WITH statements) in multiple output statements – this has the added benefit of opening fewer readers to the input source.
e.g. 

    WITH AllRedCars AS (
        SELECT
            *
        FROM
            Input TIMESTAMP BY Time
        WHERE
            Color = 'red'
    )
    SELECT * INTO HondaOutput FROM AllRedCars WHERE Make = 'Honda'
    SELECT * INTO ToyotaOutput FROM AllRedCars WHERE Make = 'Toyota'

## Query example: Counting unique values
**Description**: count the number of unique field values that appear in the stream within a time window.
e.g. How many unique make of cars passed through the toll booth in a 2 second window?

**Input**:

| Make | Time |
| --- | --- |
| Honda |2015-01-01T00:00:01.0000000Z |
| Honda |2015-01-01T00:00:02.0000000Z |
| Toyota |2015-01-01T00:00:01.0000000Z |
| Toyota |2015-01-01T00:00:02.0000000Z |
| Toyota |2015-01-01T00:00:03.0000000Z |

**Output:**

| Count | Time |
| --- | --- |
| 2 |2015-01-01T00:00:02.000Z |
| 1 |2015-01-01T00:00:04.000Z |

**Solution:**

    WITH Makes AS (
        SELECT
            Make,
            COUNT(*) AS CountMake
        FROM
            Input TIMESTAMP BY Time
        GROUP BY
              Make,
              TumblingWindow(second, 2)
    )
    SELECT
        COUNT(*) AS Count,
        System.TimeStamp AS Time
    FROM
        Makes
    GROUP BY
        TumblingWindow(second, 1)


**Explanation:**
We do an initial aggregation to get unique makes with their count over the window.
We then do an aggregation of how many makes we got – given all unique values in a window get the same timestamp then the second aggregation window needs to be minimal to not aggregate 2 windows from the first step.

## Query example: Determine if a value has changed
**Description**: Look at a previous value to determine if it is different than the current value
e.g. Is the previous car on the Toll Road the same make as the current car?

**Input**:

| Make | Time |
| --- | --- |
| Honda |2015-01-01T00:00:01.0000000Z |
| Toyota |2015-01-01T00:00:02.0000000Z |

**Output**:

| Make | Time |
| --- | --- |
| Toyota |2015-01-01T00:00:02.0000000Z |

**Solution**:

    SELECT
        Make,
        Time
    FROM
        Input TIMESTAMP BY Time
    WHERE
        LAG(Make, 1) OVER (LIMIT DURATION(minute, 1)) <> Make

**Explanation**:
Use LAG to peek into the input stream one event back and get the Make value. Then compare it to the Make on the current event and output the event if they are different.

## Query example: Find first event in a window
**Description**: Find first car in every 10 minute interval?

**Input**:

| LicensePlate | Make | Time |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DXE 5291 |Honda |2015-07-27T00:00:05.0000000Z |
| YZK 5704 |Ford |2015-07-27T00:02:17.0000000Z |
| RMV 8282 |Honda |2015-07-27T00:05:01.0000000Z |
| YHN 6970 |Toyota |2015-07-27T00:06:00.0000000Z |
| VFE 1616 |Toyota |2015-07-27T00:09:31.0000000Z |
| QYF 9358 |Honda |2015-07-27T00:12:02.0000000Z |
| MDR 6128 |BMW |2015-07-27T00:13:45.0000000Z |

**Output**:

| LicensePlate | Make | Time |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DXE 5291 |Honda |2015-07-27T00:00:05.0000000Z |
| QYF 9358 |Honda |2015-07-27T00:12:02.0000000Z |

**Solution**:

    SELECT 
        LicensePlate,
        Make,
        Time
    FROM 
        Input TIMESTAMP BY Time
    WHERE 
        IsFirst(minute, 10) = 1

Now let’s change the problem and find first car of particular Make in every 10 minute interval.

| LicensePlate | Make | Time |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DXE 5291 |Honda |2015-07-27T00:00:05.0000000Z |
| YZK 5704 |Ford |2015-07-27T00:02:17.0000000Z |
| YHN 6970 |Toyota |2015-07-27T00:06:00.0000000Z |
| QYF 9358 |Honda |2015-07-27T00:12:02.0000000Z |
| MDR 6128 |BMW |2015-07-27T00:13:45.0000000Z |

**Solution**:

    SELECT 
        LicensePlate,
        Make,
        Time
    FROM 
        Input TIMESTAMP BY Time
    WHERE 
        IsFirst(minute, 10) OVER (PARTITION BY Make) = 1

## Query example: Find last event in a window
**Description**: Find last car in every 10 minute interval.

**Input**:

| LicensePlate | Make | Time |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DXE 5291 |Honda |2015-07-27T00:00:05.0000000Z |
| YZK 5704 |Ford |2015-07-27T00:02:17.0000000Z |
| RMV 8282 |Honda |2015-07-27T00:05:01.0000000Z |
| YHN 6970 |Toyota |2015-07-27T00:06:00.0000000Z |
| VFE 1616 |Toyota |2015-07-27T00:09:31.0000000Z |
| QYF 9358 |Honda |2015-07-27T00:12:02.0000000Z |
| MDR 6128 |BMW |2015-07-27T00:13:45.0000000Z |

**Output**:

| LicensePlate | Make | Time |
| --- | --- | --- |
| VFE 1616 |Toyota |2015-07-27T00:09:31.0000000Z |
| MDR 6128 |BMW |2015-07-27T00:13:45.0000000Z |

**Solution**:

    WITH LastInWindow AS
    (
        SELECT 
            MAX(Time) AS LastEventTime
        FROM 
            Input TIMESTAMP BY Time
        GROUP BY 
            TumblingWindow(minute, 10)
    )
    SELECT 
        Input.LicensePlate,
        Input.Make,
        Input.Time
    FROM
        Input TIMESTAMP BY Time 
        INNER JOIN LastInWindow
        ON DATEDIFF(minute, Input, LastInWindow) BETWEEN 0 AND 10
        AND Input.Time = LastInWindow.LastEventTime

**Explanation**:
There are two steps in the query – the first one finds latest timestamp in 10 minute windows. The second step joins results of the first query with original stream to find events matching last timestamps in each window. 

## Query example: Detect the absence of events
**Description**: Check that a stream has no value that matches a certain criteria.
e.g. Have 2 consecutive cars from the same make entered the toll road within 90 seconds?

**Input**:

| Make | LicensePlate | Time |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Honda |ABC-123 |2015-01-01T00:00:01.0000000Z |
| Honda |AAA-999 |2015-01-01T00:00:02.0000000Z |
| Toyota |DEF-987 |2015-01-01T00:00:03.0000000Z |
| Honda |GHI-345 |2015-01-01T00:00:04.0000000Z |

**Output**:

| Make | Time | CurrentCarLicensePlate | FirstCarLicensePlate | FirstCarTime |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Honda |2015-01-01T00:00:02.0000000Z |AAA-999 |ABC-123 |2015-01-01T00:00:01.0000000Z |

**Solution**:

    SELECT
        Make,
        Time,
        LicensePlate AS CurrentCarLicensePlate,
        LAG(LicensePlate, 1) OVER (LIMIT DURATION(second, 90)) AS FirstCarLicensePlate,
        LAG(Time, 1) OVER (LIMIT DURATION(second, 90)) AS FirstCarTime
    FROM
        Input TIMESTAMP BY Time
    WHERE
        LAG(Make, 1) OVER (LIMIT DURATION(second, 90)) = Make

**Explanation**:
Use LAG to peek into the input stream one event back and get the Make value. Then compare it to the Make on the current event and output the event if they are the same and use LAG to get data about the previous car.

## Query example: Detect duration between events
**Description**: Find the duration of a given event. e.g. Given a web clickstream determine time spent on a feature.

**Input**:  

| User | Feature | Event | Time |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| user@location.com |RightMenu |Start |2015-01-01T00:00:01.0000000Z |
| user@location.com |RightMenu |End |2015-01-01T00:00:08.0000000Z |

**Output**:  

| User | Feature | Duration |
| --- | --- | --- |
| user@location.com |RightMenu |7 |

**Solution**

````
    SELECT
        [user], feature, DATEDIFF(second, LAST(Time) OVER (PARTITION BY [user], feature LIMIT DURATION(hour, 1) WHEN Event = 'start'), Time) as duration
    FROM input TIMESTAMP BY Time
    WHERE
        Event = 'end'
````

**Explanation**:
Use LAST function to retrieve last Time value when event type was ‘Start’. Note that LAST function uses PARTITION BY [user] to indicate that result shall be computed per unique user.  The query has a 1 hour maximum threshold for time difference between ‘Start’ and ‘Stop’ events but is configurable as needed (LIMIT DURATION(hour, 1).

## Query example: Detect duration of a condition
**Description**: Find out how long a condition occurred for.
e.g. Suppose that a bug that resulted in all cars having an incorrect weight (above 20,000 pounds) – we want to compute the duration of the bug.

**Input**:

| Make | Time | Weight |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Honda |2015-01-01T00:00:01.0000000Z |2000 |
| Toyota |2015-01-01T00:00:02.0000000Z |25000 |
| Honda |2015-01-01T00:00:03.0000000Z |26000 |
| Toyota |2015-01-01T00:00:04.0000000Z |25000 |
| Honda |2015-01-01T00:00:05.0000000Z |26000 |
| Toyota |2015-01-01T00:00:06.0000000Z |25000 |
| Honda |2015-01-01T00:00:07.0000000Z |26000 |
| Toyota |2015-01-01T00:00:08.0000000Z |2000 |

**Output**:

| StartFault | EndFault |
| --- | --- |
| 2015-01-01T00:00:02.000Z |2015-01-01T00:00:07.000Z |

**Solution**:

````
    WITH SelectPreviousEvent AS
    (
    SELECT
    *,
        LAG([time]) OVER (LIMIT DURATION(hour, 24)) as previousTime,
        LAG([weight]) OVER (LIMIT DURATION(hour, 24)) as previousWeight
    FROM input TIMESTAMP BY [time]
    )

    SELECT 
        LAG(time) OVER (LIMIT DURATION(hour, 24) WHEN previousWeight < 20000 ) [StartFault],
        previousTime [EndFault]
    FROM SelectPreviousEvent
    WHERE
        [weight] < 20000
        AND previousWeight > 20000
````

**Explanation**:
Use LAG to view the input stream for 24 hours and look for instances where StartFault and StopFault are spanned by weight < 20000.

## Query example: Fill missing values
**Description**: For the stream of events that have missing values, produce a stream of events with regular intervals.
For example, generate event every 5 seconds that will report the most recently seen data point.

**Input**:

| t | value |
| --- | --- |
| "2014-01-01T06:01:00" |1 |
| "2014-01-01T06:01:05" |2 |
| "2014-01-01T06:01:10" |3 |
| "2014-01-01T06:01:15" |4 |
| "2014-01-01T06:01:30" |5 |
| "2014-01-01T06:01:35" |6 |

**Output (first 10 rows)**:

| windowend | lastevent.t | lastevent.value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2014-01-01T14:01:00.000Z |2014-01-01T14:01:00.000Z |1 |
| 2014-01-01T14:01:05.000Z |2014-01-01T14:01:05.000Z |2 |
| 2014-01-01T14:01:10.000Z |2014-01-01T14:01:10.000Z |3 |
| 2014-01-01T14:01:15.000Z |2014-01-01T14:01:15.000Z |4 |
| 2014-01-01T14:01:20.000Z |2014-01-01T14:01:15.000Z |4 |
| 2014-01-01T14:01:25.000Z |2014-01-01T14:01:15.000Z |4 |
| 2014-01-01T14:01:30.000Z |2014-01-01T14:01:30.000Z |5 |
| 2014-01-01T14:01:35.000Z |2014-01-01T14:01:35.000Z |6 |
| 2014-01-01T14:01:40.000Z |2014-01-01T14:01:35.000Z |6 |
| 2014-01-01T14:01:45.000Z |2014-01-01T14:01:35.000Z |6 |

**Solution**:

    SELECT
        System.Timestamp AS windowEnd,
        TopOne() OVER (ORDER BY t DESC) AS lastEvent
    FROM
        input TIMESTAMP BY t
    GROUP BY HOPPINGWINDOW(second, 300, 5)


**Explanation**:
This query will generate events every 5 second and will output the last event that was received before. [Hopping Window](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn835041.aspx "Hopping Window - Azure Stream Analytics") duration determines how far back the query will look to find the latest event (300 seconds in this example).
