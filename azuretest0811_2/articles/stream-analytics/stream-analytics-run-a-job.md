# How to run a streaming job in Azure Stream Analytics
When a job input, query and output have all been specified you can start the Stream Analytics job.

To start your job:

1. In the Azure Classic Portal, from the job dashboard, click **Start** at the bottom of the page.

   In the Azure Portal, click **Start** at the top of your job page.

2. Specify a **Start Output** value to determine when this job will start producing output. The default setting for jobs that have not previously been started is **Job Start Time**, which means that the job will immediately start processing data. You can also specify a **Custom** time in the past (for consuming historical data) or the future (to delay processing until a future time). For cases when a job has been previously started and stopped, the option **Last Stopped Time** is available in order to resume the job from the last output time and avoid data loss.

3. Confirm your selection. The job status will change to *Starting* and will shortly move to *Running* once the job has started. You can monitor the progress of the **Start** operation in the **Notification Hub**:
