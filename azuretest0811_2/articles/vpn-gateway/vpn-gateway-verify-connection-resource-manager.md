# Verify a gateway connection
You can verify your gateway connection in a few different ways. This article will show you how to verify the status of a Resource Manager gateway connection by using the Azure portal and by using PowerShell.

## Before you begin
If you plan to use PowerShell, you'll need to install the latest version of the Azure Resource Manager PowerShell cmdlets. See [How to install and configure Azure PowerShell](../powershell-install-configure.md) for more information about installing the PowerShell cmdlets. For more information about using Resource Manager cmdlets, see [Using Windows PowerShell with Resource Manager](../powershell-azure-resource-manager.md).

1. Open your PowerShell console and connect to your account.
   
        Login-AzureRmAccount
2. Check the subscriptions for the account.
   
        Get-AzureRmSubscription 
3. Specify the subscription that you want to use.
   
        Select-AzureRmSubscription -SubscriptionName "Replace_with_your_subscription_name"
