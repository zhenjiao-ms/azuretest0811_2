# About VPN devices for Site-to-Site VPN Gateway connections
A VPN device is required in order to configure a Site-to-Site (S2S) VPN connection. Site-to-Site connections can be used to create a hybrid solution, or whenever you want a secure connection between your on-premises network and your virtual network. This article discusses compatible VPN devices and configuration parameters. Please note that when configuring a Site-to-Site connection, a public-facing IPv4 IP address is required for your VPN device.                                                                                                                                                                                

If your device doesn't appear in the Validated VPN devices table, see the Non-validated VPN devices section of this article. It's possible that your device may still work with Azure. For VPN device support, please contact your device manufacturer.

**Items to note when viewing the tables:**

* There has been a terminology change for static and dynamic routing. You'll likely run into both terms. There is no functionality change, only the names are changing.
  * Static Routing = Policy-based
  * Dynamic Routing = Route-based 
* Specifications for High Performance VPN gateway and route-based VPN gateway are the same unless otherwise noted. For example, the validated VPN devices that are compatible with route-based VPN gateways will also be compatible with the new Azure High Performance VPN gateway. 

## Validated VPN devices
We have validated a set of standard VPN devices in partnership with device vendors. All of the devices in the device families contained in the list below should work with Azure VPN gateways. See the [VPN gateways](vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways.md) article to verify the type of gateway that you'll need to create for the solution you want to configure. 

To help configure your VPN device, please refer to the links that correspond to appropriate device family.

## Non-validated VPN devices
If you don’t see your device listed in the Validated VPN devices table (above), it still may work with a Site-to-Site connection. Verify that your VPN device meets the minimum requirements outlined in the Gateway Requirements section of the [About VPN Gateways](vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways.md#gateway-requirements) article. Devices meeting the minimum requirements should also work well with VPN gateways. Please contact your device manufacturer for additional support and configuration instructions.

## Editing device configuration samples
After you download the provided VPN device configuration sample, you’ll need to replace some of the values to reflect the settings for your environment. 

**To edit a sample:**

1. Open the sample using Notepad. 
2. Search and replace all <*text*> strings with the values that pertain to your environment. Be sure to include < and >. When a name is specified, the name you select should be unique. If a command does not work, please consult your device manufacturer documentation.

| **Sample text** | **Change to** |
| --- | --- |
| &lt;RP_OnPremisesNetwork&gt; |Your chosen name for this object. Example: myOnPremisesNetwork |
| &lt;RP_AzureNetwork&gt; |Your chosen name for this object. Example: myAzureNetwork |
| &lt;RP_AccessList&gt; |Your chosen name for this object. Example: myAzureAccessList |
| &lt;RP_IPSecTransformSet&gt; |Your chosen name for this object. Example: myIPSecTransformSet |
| &lt;RP_IPSecCryptoMap&gt; |Your chosen name for this object. Example: myIPSecCryptoMap |
| &lt;SP_AzureNetworkIpRange&gt; |Specify range. Example: 192.168.0.0 |
| &lt;SP_AzureNetworkSubnetMask&gt; |Specify subnet mask. Example: 255.255.0.0 |
| &lt;SP_OnPremisesNetworkIpRange&gt; |Specify on-premises range. Example: 10.2.1.0 |
| &lt;SP_OnPremisesNetworkSubnetMask&gt; |Specify on-premises subnet mask. Example: 255.255.255.0 |
| &lt;SP_AzureGatewayIpAddress&gt; |This information specific to your virtual network and is located in the Management Portal as **Gateway IP address**. |
| &lt;SP_PresharedKey&gt; |This information is specific to your virtual network and is located in the Management Portal as Manage Key. |

## IPsec Parameters
> [!NOTE]
> Although the values listed below are supported by the Azure VPN Gateway, currently there is no way for you to specify or select a specific combination from the Azure VPN Gateway. You must specify any constraints from the on-premises VPN device. In addition, you must clamp MSS at 1350.

* You can specify IPsec ESP NULL encryption with route-based and High Performance VPN gateways. Null based encryption does not provide protection to data in transit, and should only be used when maximum throughput and minimum latency is required.  Clients may chose to use this in vnet-to-vnet communication scenarios, or when encryption is being applied elsewhere in the solution.
* For cross-premises connectivity through the Internet, please use the default Azure VPN gateway settings with encryption and hashing algorithms listed in the tables above to ensure security of your critical communication.
