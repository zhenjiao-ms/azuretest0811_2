# Azure VPN Gateway connections
This article shows the baseline VPN gateway connection topologies. You can use the graphics and descriptions to help select the configuration topology to match your requirements. While this article goes through the main baseline topologies, it's possible to build more complex topologies using the diagrams as a guideline.

Each topology contains a table listing the deployment model that the topology is available for, the deployment tools that you can use to configure each topology, and will link directly to an article if an article is available. We update the tables frequently as new articles and deployment tools become available for you to use.

After deciding on the connection that you want to create, the instructions that you use to create your VPN gateway will depend on the deployment model that you used to create your virtual network. For example, if you created your VNet using the classic deployment model, you'll use the guidelines and instructions for the classic deployment model to create and configure your VPN gateway. You can't create a Resource Manager VPN gateway for a classic deployment model virtual network. See [Understanding Resource Manager and classic deployment models](../resource-manager-deployment-model.md) for more information about deployment models.

## Site-to-Site and Multi-Site
A Site-to-Site connection is a connection over IPsec/IKE (IKEv1 or IKEv2) VPN tunnel. This type of connection requires a VPN device or Windows Server RRAS on-premises. Site-to-site connections can be used for cross-premises and hybrid configurations.

You can create and configure more than one S2S VPN connections to your on-premises networks if you are using Azure Route-Based VPNs. This type of configuration is often called a "multi-site" connection.

## VNet-to-VNet
Connecting a virtual network to another virtual network (VNet-to-VNet) is very similar to connecting a VNet to an on-premises site location. Both connectivity types use an Azure VPN gateway to provide a secure tunnel using IPsec/IKE. The VNets you connect can be in different regions, or in different subscriptions. You can even combine VNet-to-VNet communication with multi-site configurations. This lets you establish network topologies that combine cross-premises connectivity with inter-virtual network connectivity.

Azure currently has two deployment models: Azure Service Management (referred to as classic), and Azure Resource Manager. If you have been using Azure for some time, you probably have Azure VMs and instance roles running on a classic VNet, while your newer VMs and role instances may be running on a VNet created in ARM. You can create a connection between virtual networks even if they are in different deployment models.

## Point-to-Site
A Point-to-Site configuration allows you to create a secure connection to your virtual network from a client computer, individually. A VPN connection is established by starting the connection from the client computer. This is a useful solution when you want to connect to your VNet from a remote location, such as from home or a conference, or when you only have a few clients that need to connect to a virtual network. 

A Point-to-Site connection is a VPN connection over SSTP (Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol). Point-to-Site connections do not require a VPN device or a public-facing IP address to work.

For more information about ExpressRoute, see the [ExpressRoute technical overview](../expressroute/expressroute-introduction.md).

## Site-to-Site and ExpressRoute coexisting connections
ExpressRoute is a direct, dedicated connection to Microsoft Services, including Azure, from your WAN, not over the public Internet. Site-to-Site VPN traffic travels encrypted over the public Internet. Having the ability to configure Site-to-Site VPN and ExpressRoute connections for the same virtual network has several advantages. You can configure Site-to-Site VPN as a secure failover path for ExpressRoute, or use Site-to-Site VPNs to connect to sites that are not part of your network, but that are connected through ExpressRoute.
