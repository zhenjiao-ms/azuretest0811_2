A Point-to-Site configuration allows you to create a secure connection to your virtual network from a client computer, individually. A VPN connection is established by starting the connection from the client computer. Point-to-Site is an excellent solution when you want to connect to your VNet from a remote location, such as from home or a conference, or when you only have a few clients that need to connect to a virtual network. 

Point-to-Site connections do not require a VPN device or a public-facing IP address to work. For more information about Point-to-Site connections, see the [VPN Gateway FAQ](vpn-gateway-vpn-faq.md#point-to-site-connections) and [About cross-premises connections](vpn-gateway-cross-premises-options.md).

This article applies to Point-to-Site VPN Gateway connections to a virtual network created using the **Resource Manager deployment model** (Service Management).

## About this configuration
In this scenario, you will create a virtual network with a Point-to-Site connection. A Point-to-Site connection is composed of the following items: VNet with a gateway, an uploaded root certificate .cer file, a client certificate, and the VPN configuration on the client side. 

We'll use the following values for this configuration:

* Name: **TestVNet**, using address spaces **192.168.0.0/16** and **10.254.0.0/16**. Notice that you can use more than one address space for a VNet.
* Subnet name: **FrontEnd**, using **192.168.1.0/24**
* Subnet name: **BackEnd**, using **10.254.1.0/24**
* Subnet name: **GatewaySubnet**, using **192.168.200.0/24**. The Subnet name *GatewaySubnet* is mandatory for the gateway to work. 
* VPN client address pool: **172.16.201.0/24**. VPN clients that connect to the VNet using this Point-to-Site connection will receive an IP address from this pool.
* Subscription: Verify that you have the correct subscription if you have more than one.
* Resource Group: **TestRG**
* Location: **East US**
* DNS Server: **IP address** of the DNS server that you want to use for name resolution.
* GW Name: **GW**
* Public IP name: **GWIP**
* VpnType: **RouteBased**

## Before beginning
* Verify that you have an Azure subscription. If you don't already have an Azure subscription, you can activate your [MSDN subscriber benefits](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/member-offers/msdn-benefits-details/) or sign up for a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).
* You'll need to install the Azure Resource Manager PowerShell cmdlets (1.0.2 or later). See [How to install and configure Azure PowerShell](../powershell-install-configure.md) for more information about installing the PowerShell cmdlets.

## Configure a Point-to-Site connection for Azure
1. In the PowerShell console, log in to your Azure account. This cmdlet prompts you for the login credentials for your Azure Account. After logging in, it downloads your account settings so that they are available to Azure PowerShell.
   
        Login-AzureRmAccount 
2. Get a list of your Azure subscriptions.
   
        Get-AzureRmSubscription
3. Specify the subscription that you want to use. 
   
        Select-AzureRmSubscription -SubscriptionName "Name of subscription"
4. In this configuration, the following PowerShell variables are declared with the values that you want to use. The declared values will be used in the sample scripts. Declare the values that you want to use. Use the sample below, substituting the values for your own when necessary. 
   
        $VNetName  = "TestVNet"
        $FESubName = "FrontEnd"
        $BESubName = "Backend"
        $GWSubName = "GatewaySubnet"
        $VNetPrefix1 = "192.168.0.0/16"
        $VNetPrefix2 = "10.254.0.0/16"
        $FESubPrefix = "192.168.1.0/24"
        $BESubPrefix = "10.254.1.0/24"
        $GWSubPrefix = "192.168.200.0/26"
        $VPNClientAddressPool = "172.16.201.0/24"
        $RG = "TestRG"
        $Location = "East US"
        $DNS = "8.8.8.8"
        $GWName = "GW"
        $GWIPName = "GWIP"
        $GWIPconfName = "gwipconf"
        $P2SRootCertName = "ARMP2SRootCert.cer"
5. Create a new resource group.
   
        New-AzureRmResourceGroup -Name $RG -Location $Location
6. Create the subnet configurations for the virtual network, naming them *FrontEnd*, *BackEnd*, and *GatewaySubnet*. Note that these prefixes must be part of the VNet address space declared above.
   
        $fesub = New-AzureRmVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig -Name $FESubName -AddressPrefix $FESubPrefix
        $besub = New-AzureRmVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig -Name $BESubName -AddressPrefix $BESubPrefix
        $gwsub = New-AzureRmVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig -Name $GWSubName -AddressPrefix $GWSubPrefix
7. Create the virtual network. Note that the DNS server specified should be a DNS server that can resolve the names for the resources you are connecting to. For this example, we used a public IP address, but you will want to put in your own values here.
   
        New-AzureRmVirtualNetwork -Name $VNetName -ResourceGroupName $RG -Location $Location -AddressPrefix $VNetPrefix1,$VNetPrefix2 -Subnet $fesub, $besub, $gwsub -DnsServer $DNS
8. Specify the variables for the virtual network you just created.
   
        $vnet = Get-AzureRmVirtualNetwork -Name $VNetName -ResourceGroupName $RG
        $subnet = Get-AzureRmVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig -Name "GatewaySubnet" -VirtualNetwork $vnet
9. Request a dynamically assigned public IP address. This IP address is necessary for the gateway to work properly. You will later connect the gateway to the gateway IP configuration.
   
        $pip = New-AzureRmPublicIpAddress -Name $GWIPName -ResourceGroupName $RG -Location $Location -AllocationMethod Dynamic
        $ipconf = New-AzureRmVirtualNetworkGatewayIpConfig -Name $GWIPconfName -Subnet $subnet -PublicIpAddress $pip
10. Upload a root certificate .cer file to Azure. You can use a root certificate from your enterprise certificate environment, or you can use a self-signed root certificate. You can upload up to 20 root certificates. For instructions to create a self-signed root certificate using *makecert*, see [Working with self-signed root certificates for Point-to-Site configurations](vpn-gateway-certificates-point-to-site.md). Note that the .cer file should not contain the private key of the root certificate. To get the public key as shown in the example below, export the .cer file as a Base-64 encoded X.509 (.CER) file then open that file with notepad. There copy everything in between: -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- & -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    
    Below is a sample of what this looks like. The challenging part of uploading the public certificate data is that you must copy and paste the entire string with no spaces. Otherwise, the upload will not work. You'll need to use your own certificate .cer file for this step. Don't try to copy and paste the sample from below.
    
        $MyP2SRootCertPubKeyBase64 = "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"
        $p2srootcert = New-AzureRmVpnClientRootCertificate -Name $P2SRootCertName -PublicCertData $MyP2SRootCertPubKeyBase64
11. Create the virtual network gateway for your VNet. The GatewayType must be Vpn and the VpnType must be RouteBased.
    
        New-AzureRmVirtualNetworkGateway -Name $GWName -ResourceGroupName $RG -Location $Location -IpConfigurations $ipconf -GatewayType Vpn -VpnType RouteBased -EnableBgp $false -GatewaySku Standard -VpnClientAddressPool $VPNClientAddressPool -VpnClientRootCertificates $p2srootcert

## Client configuration
Each client that connects to Azure by using Point-to-Site must have two things: the VPN client must be configured to connect, and the client must have a client certificate installed. VPN client configuration packages are available for Windows clients. Please see the [VPN Gateway FAQ](vpn-gateway-vpn-faq.md#point-to-site-connections) for more information. 

1. Download the VPN client configuration package. In this step, use the following example to download the client configuration package.
   
        Get-AzureRmVpnClientPackage -ResourceGroupName $RG -VirtualNetworkGatewayName $GWName -ProcessorArchitecture Amd64
   
    The PowerShell cmdlet will return a URL link. Copy-paste the link that is returned to a web browser to download the package to your computer. Below is an example of what the returned URL will look like.
   
        "https://mdsbrketwprodsn1prod.blob.core.windows.net/cmakexe/4a431aa7-b5c2-45d9-97a0-859940069d3f/amd64/4a431aa7-b5c2-45d9-97a0-859940069d3f.exe?sv=2014-02-14&sr=b&sig=jSNCNQ9aUKkCiEokdo%2BqvfjAfyhSXGnRG0vYAv4efg0%3D&st=2016-01-08T07%3A10%3A08Z&se=2016-01-08T08%3A10%3A08Z&sp=r&fileExtension=.exe"
2. Generate and install the client certificates (*.pfx) created from the root certificate on the client computers. You can use any method of installing that you are comfortable with. If you are using a self-signed root certificate and are unfamiliar with how to do this, you can refer to [Working with self-signed root certificates for Point-to-Site configurations](vpn-gateway-certificates-point-to-site.md). 
3. To connect to your VNet, on the client computer, navigate to VPN connections and locate the VPN connection that you just created. It will be named the same name as your virtual network. Click **Connect**. A pop up message may appear that refers to using the certificate. If this happens, click **Continue** to use elevated privileges. 
4. On the **Connection** status page, click **Connect** in order to start the connection. If you see a **Select Certificate** screen, verify that the client certificate showing is the one that you want to use to connect. If it is not, use the drop-down arrow to select the correct certificate, and then click **OK**.
5. Your connection should now be established. You can verify your connection by using the procedure below.

## Verify your connection
1. To verify that your VPN connection is active, open an elevated command prompt, and run *ipconfig/all*.
2. View the results. Notice that the IP address you received is one of the addresses within the Point-to-Site VPN Client Address Pool that you specified in your configuration. The results should be something similar to this:
   
        PPP adapter VNetEast:
            Connection-specific DNS Suffix .:
            Description.....................: VNetEast
            Physical Address................:
            DHCP Enabled....................: No
            Autoconfiguration Enabled.......: Yes
            IPv4 Address....................: 172.16.201.3(Preferred)
            Subnet Mask.....................: 255.255.255.255
            Default Gateway.................:
            NetBIOS over Tcpip..............: Enabled

## To add or remove a root certificate
Certificates are used to authenticate VPN clients for Point-to-Site VPNs. The following steps will walk you through adding and removing root certificates.

### Add a root certificate
You can add up to 20 root certificates to Azure. Follow the steps below to add a root certificate.

1. Create and prepare the new root certificate for upload.
   
        $P2SRootCertName2 = "ARMP2SRootCert2.cer"
        $MyP2SCertPubKeyBase64_2 = "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"
2. Upload the new root certificate. Note that you can only add one root certificate at a time.
   
        Add-AzureRmVpnClientRootCertificate -VpnClientRootCertificateName $P2SRootCertName2 -VirtualNetworkGatewayname $GWName -ResourceGroupName $RG -PublicCertData $MyP2SCertPubKeyBase64_2
3. You can verify that the new certificate was added correctly by using the following cmdlet.
   
        Get-AzureRmVpnClientRootCertificate -ResourceGroupName $RG -VirtualNetworkGatewayName $GWName

### Remove a root certificate
You can remove a root certificate from Azure. When you remove a root certificate, client certificates that were generated from the root certificate will no longer be able to connect to Azure via Point-to-Site until they install a client certificate that is generated from a root certificate that is valid in Azure.

1. Remove a root certificate.
   
        Remove-AzureRmVpnClientRootCertificate -VpnClientRootCertificateName $P2SRootCertName2 -VirtualNetworkGatewayName $GWName -ResourceGroupName $RG -PublicCertData "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"
2. Use the following cmdlet to verify that the certificate was removed successfully. 
   
        Get-AzureRmVpnClientRootCertificate -ResourceGroupName $RG -VirtualNetworkGatewayName $GWName

## Manage the list of revoked client certificates
You can revoke client certificates. The certificate revocation list allows you to selectively deny Point-to-Site connectivity based on individual client certificates. While removing a root certificate from Azure will revoke the access for all client certificates generated/signed by the revoked root certificate, revoking a client certificate will allow you to remove access for a particular certificate. The common practice is to use the root certificate to manage access at team or organization levels, while using revoked client certificates for fine-grained access control on individual users.

### Revoke a client certificate
1. Get the thumbprint of the client certificate to revoke.
   
        $RevokedClientCert1 = "ClientCert1"
        $RevokedThumbprint1 = "‎ef2af033d0686820f5a3c74804d167b88b69982f"
2. Add the thumbprint to the list of revoked thumbprint.
   
        Add-AzureRmVpnClientRevokedCertificate -VpnClientRevokedCertificateName $RevokedClientCert1 -VirtualNetworkGatewayName $GWName -ResourceGroupName $RG -Thumbprint $RevokedThumbprint1
3. Verify that the thumbprint was added to the certificate revocation list. You need to add one thumbprint at a time.
   
        Get-AzureRmVpnClientRevokedCertificate -VirtualNetworkGatewayName $GWName -ResourceGroupName $RG

### Reinstate a client certificate
You can reinstate a client certificate by removing the thumbprint from the list of revoked client certificates.

1. Remove the thumbprint from the list of revoked client certificate thumbprint.
   
       Remove-AzureRmVpnClientRevokedCertificate -VpnClientRevokedCertificateName $RevokedClientCert1 -VirtualNetworkGatewayName $GWName -ResourceGroupName $RG -Thumbprint $RevokedThumbprint1
2. Check if the thumbprint is removed from the revoked list.
   
        Get-AzureRmVpnClientRevokedCertificate -VirtualNetworkGatewayName $GWName -ResourceGroupName $RG

## Next steps
You can add a virtual machine to your virtual network. See [Create a Virtual Machine](../virtual-machines/virtual-machines-windows-hero-tutorial.md) for steps.
