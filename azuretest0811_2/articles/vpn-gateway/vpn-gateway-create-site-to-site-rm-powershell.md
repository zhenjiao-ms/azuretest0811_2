This article will walk you through creating a virtual network and a Site-to-Site VPN connection to your on-premises network using the Azure Resource Manager deployment model. Site-to-Site connections can be used for cross-premises and hybrid configurations. 

**About Azure deployment models**

**Deployment models and tools for Site-to-Site connections**

[!INCLUDE [vpn-gateway-table-site-to-site](../../includes/vpn-gateway-table-site-to-site-include.md)]

If you want to connect VNets together, but are not creating a connection to an on-premises location, see [Configure a VNet-to-VNet connection](vpn-gateway-vnet-vnet-rm-ps.md). If you are looking for a different type of connection configuration, see the [VPN Gateway connection topologies](vpn-gateway-topology.md) article.

## Before you begin
Verify that you have the following items before beginning configuration.

* A compatible VPN device and someone who is able to configure it. See [About VPN Devices](vpn-gateway-about-vpn-devices.md). If you aren't familiar with configuring your VPN device, or are unfamiliar with the IP address ranges located in your on-premises network configuration, you'll need to coordinate with someone who can provide those details for you.
* An externally-facing public IP address for your VPN device. This IP address cannot be located behind a NAT.
* An Azure subscription. If you don't already have an Azure subscription, you can activate your [MSDN subscriber benefits](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/member-offers/msdn-benefits-details/) or sign up for a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).
* You'll need to install the latest version of the Azure Resource Manager PowerShell cmdlets. See [How to install and configure Azure PowerShell](../powershell-install-configure.md) for more information about installing the PowerShell cmdlets.

## 1. Connect to your subscription
Make sure you switch to PowerShell mode to use the Resource Manager cmdlets. For more information, see [Using Windows PowerShell with Resource Manager](../powershell-azure-resource-manager.md).

Open your PowerShell console and connect to your account. Use the following sample to help you connect:

    Login-AzureRmAccount

Check the subscriptions for the account.

    Get-AzureRmSubscription 

Specify the subscription that you want to use.

    Select-AzureRmSubscription -SubscriptionName "Replace_with_your_subscription_name"

## 2. Create a virtual network and a gateway subnet
Our examples below show a gateway subnet of /28. While it's possible to create a gateway subnet as small as /29, we don't recommend this. We do recommend creating a gateway subnet /27 or larger (/26, /25, etc.) in order to accommodate additional feature requirements. 

If you already have a virtual network with a gateway subnet that is /29 or larger, you can jump ahead to [Add your local network gateway](#localnet).

[!INCLUDE [vpn-gateway-no-nsg](../../includes/vpn-gateway-no-nsg-include.md)]

### To create a virtual network and a gateway subnet
Use the sample below to create a virtual network and a gateway subnet. Substitute the values for your own. 

First, create a resource group:

    New-AzureRmResourceGroup -Name testrg -Location 'West US'

Next, create your virtual network. Verify that the address spaces you specify don't overlap any of the address spaces that you have on your on-premises network.

The sample below creates a virtual network named *testvnet* and two subnets, one called *GatewaySubnet* and the other called *Subnet1*. It's important to create one subnet named specifically *GatewaySubnet*. If you name it something else, your connection configuration will fail. 

    $subnet1 = New-AzureRmVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig -Name 'GatewaySubnet' -AddressPrefix 10.0.0.0/28
    $subnet2 = New-AzureRmVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig -Name 'Subnet1' -AddressPrefix '10.0.1.0/28'
    New-AzureRmVirtualNetwork -Name testvnet -ResourceGroupName testrg -Location 'West US' -AddressPrefix 10.0.0.0/16 -Subnet $subnet1, $subnet2

### <a name="gatewaysubnet"></a>To add a gateway subnet to a virtual network you have already created
This step is required only if you need to add a gateway subnet to a VNet that you previously created.

You can create your gateway subnet by using the sample below. Be sure to name the gateway subnet 'GatewaySubnet'. If you name it something else, you'll create a subnet, but Azure won't treat it as a gateway subnet.

    $vnet = Get-AzureRmVirtualNetwork -ResourceGroupName testrg -Name testvnet
    Add-AzureRmVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig -Name 'GatewaySubnet' -AddressPrefix 10.0.3.0/28 -VirtualNetwork $vnet

Now, set the configuration. 

    Set-AzureRmVirtualNetwork -VirtualNetwork $vnet

## 3. <a name="localnet"></a>Add your local network gateway
In a virtual network, the local network gateway typically refers to your on-premises location. You'll give that site a name by which Azure can refer to it, and also specify the address space prefix for the local network gateway. 

Azure will use the IP address prefix you specify to identify which traffic to send to your on-premises location. This means that you'll have to specify each address prefix that you want to be associated with your local network gateway. You can easily update these prefixes if your on-premises network changes. 

When using the PowerShell examples, note the following:

* The *GatewayIPAddress* is the IP address of your on-premises VPN device. Your VPN device cannot be located behind a NAT. 
* The *AddressPrefix* is your on-premises address space.

To add a local network gateway with a single address prefix:

    New-AzureRmLocalNetworkGateway -Name LocalSite -ResourceGroupName testrg -Location 'West US' -GatewayIpAddress '23.99.221.164' -AddressPrefix '10.5.51.0/24'

To add a local network gateway with multiple address prefixes:

    New-AzureRmLocalNetworkGateway -Name LocalSite -ResourceGroupName testrg -Location 'West US' -GatewayIpAddress '23.99.221.164' -AddressPrefix @('10.0.0.0/24','20.0.0.0/24')

### To modify IP address prefixes for your local network gateway
Sometimes your local network gateway prefixes change. The steps you take to modify your IP address prefixes depend on whether or not you have created a VPN gateway connection. See the [Modify IP address prefixes for a local network gateway](#modify) section of this article.

## 4. Request a public IP address for the VPN gateway
Next, you'll request a public IP address to be allocated to your Azure VNet VPN gateway. This is not the same IP address that is assigned to your VPN device; rather it's assigned to the Azure VPN gateway itself. You cannot specify the IP address that you want to use; it is dynamically allocated to your gateway. You'll use this IP address when configuring your on-premises VPN device to connect to the gateway.

Use the PowerShell sample below. The Allocation Method for this address must be Dynamic. 

    $gwpip= New-AzureRmPublicIpAddress -Name gwpip -ResourceGroupName testrg -Location 'West US' -AllocationMethod Dynamic

> [!NOTE]
> The Azure VPN gateway for the Resource Manager deployment model currently only supports public IP addresses by using the Dynamic Allocation method. However, this does not mean the IP address will change. The only time the Azure VPN gateway IP address changes is when the gateway is deleted and re-created. The gateway public IP address will not change across resizing, resetting, or other internal maintenance/upgrades of your Azure VPN gateway.
> 
> 

## 5. Create the gateway IP addressing configuration
The gateway configuration defines the subnet and the public IP address to use. Use the sample below to create your gateway configuration. 

    $vnet = Get-AzureRmVirtualNetwork -Name testvnet -ResourceGroupName testrg
    $subnet = Get-AzureRmVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig -Name 'GatewaySubnet' -VirtualNetwork $vnet
    $gwipconfig = New-AzureRmVirtualNetworkGatewayIpConfig -Name gwipconfig1 -SubnetId $subnet.Id -PublicIpAddressId $gwpip.Id 

## 6. Create the virtual network gateway
In this step, you'll create the virtual network gateway. Note that that creating a gateway can take a long time to complete. Often 20 minutes or more. 

Use the following values:

* The *-GatewayType* for a Site-to-Site configuration is *Vpn*. The gateway type is always specific to the configuration that you are implementing. For example, other gateway configurations may require -GatewayType ExpressRoute. 
* The *-VpnType* can be *RouteBased* (referred to as a Dynamic Gateway in some documentation), or *PolicyBased* (referred to as a Static Gateway in some documentation). For more information about VPN gateway types, see [About VPN Gateways](vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways.md#vpntype).
* The *-GatewaySku* can be *Basic*, *Standard*, or *HighPerformance*.     
  
        New-AzureRmVirtualNetworkGateway -Name vnetgw1 -ResourceGroupName testrg -Location 'West US' -IpConfigurations $gwipconfig -GatewayType Vpn -VpnType RouteBased -GatewaySku Standard

## 7. Configure your VPN device
At this point, you'll need the public IP address of the virtual network gateway for configuring your on-premises VPN device. Work with your device manufacturer for specific configuration information. Additionally, refer to the [VPN Devices](vpn-gateway-about-vpn-devices.md) for more information.

To find the public IP address of your virtual network gateway, use the following sample:

    Get-AzureRmPublicIpAddress -Name gwpip -ResourceGroupName testrg

## 8. Create the VPN connection
Next, you'll create the Site-to-Site VPN connection between your virtual network gateway and your VPN device. Be sure to replace the values with your own. The shared key must match the value you used for your VPN device configuration. Note that the `-ConnectionType` for Site-to-Site is *IPsec*. 

    $gateway1 = Get-AzureRmVirtualNetworkGateway -Name vnetgw1 -ResourceGroupName testrg
    $local = Get-AzureRmLocalNetworkGateway -Name LocalSite -ResourceGroupName testrg

    New-AzureRmVirtualNetworkGatewayConnection -Name localtovon -ResourceGroupName testrg -Location 'West US' -VirtualNetworkGateway1 $gateway1 -LocalNetworkGateway2 $local -ConnectionType IPsec -RoutingWeight 10 -SharedKey 'abc123'

After a short while, the connection will be established. 

## 9. Verify a VPN connection
There are a few different ways to verify your VPN connection. Below, we'll talk about how to do basic verification by using the Azure portal and by using PowerShell.

[!INCLUDE [vpn-gateway-verify-connection-rm](../../includes/vpn-gateway-verify-connection-rm-include.md)]

## <a name="modify"></a>To modify IP address prefixes for a local network gateway
If you need to change the prefixes for your local network gateway, use the instructions below.  Two sets of instructions are provided. The instructions you choose depends on whether you have already created your VPN gateway connection. 

[!INCLUDE [vpn-gateway-modify-ip-prefix-rm](../../includes/vpn-gateway-modify-ip-prefix-rm-include.md)]

## Next steps
* You can add virtual machines to your virtual networks. See [Create a Virtual Machine](../virtual-machines/virtual-machines-windows-hero-tutorial.md) for steps.
