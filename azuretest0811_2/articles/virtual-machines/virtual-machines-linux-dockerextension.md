# Using the Docker VM Extension to deploy your environment
Docker is a popular container management and imaging platform that allows you to quickly work with containers on Linux (and Windows as well). With Azure, you have the flexibility to deploy Docker in a few different manners depending on your needs:

* To quickly prototype an app, you can [use the Docker Machine Azure driver](virtual-machines-linux-docker-machine.md) to deploy Docker hosts within Azure.
* The Docker VM extension for Azure virtual machines is used for template-based deployments. This approach can integrate with Azure Resource Manager template deployments and includes all the related benefits such as role base access, diagnostics, and post deployment configuration.
* The Docker VM extension also supports Docker Compose. Docker Compose uses a declarative YAML file to take a developer-modeled application across any environment and generate a consistent deployment.
* You can also [deploy a full Docker Swarm cluster on Azure Container Services](../container-service/container-service-deployment.md) for production-ready, scalable deployments that use the additional scheduling and management tools provided by Swarm.

This article focuses on using Resource Manager templates to deploy the Docker VM Extension in a custom, production-ready environment that you define.

## Azure Docker VM Extension for template deployments
The Azure Docker VM Extension installs and configures the Docker daemon, Docker client, and Docker Compose in your Linux virtual machine. The extension is also used to define and deploy container applications using Docker compose. You have additional controls over using Docker Machine or creating the Docker host yourself, making it suited for more robust developer or production environments.

Using Azure Resource Manager, you can create and deploy templates that define the entire structure of your environment. Templates allow you to define the Docker hosts, storage, Role Based Access Controls (RBAC), diagnostics, etc. You can [read more about Resource Manager](../resource-group-overview.md) and templates to better understand some of the benefits. By using Resource Manager templates, you will also be able to reproduce the deployments as needed in the future.

## Deploy a template with the Docker VM Extension:
Let's use an existing quick-start template to show how to deploy an Ubuntu VM that has the Docker VM Extension installed. You can view the template here: [Simple deployment of an Ubuntu VM with Docker](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/docker-simple-on-ubuntu)

Deploy the template using the Azure CLI, specifying a name for our new resource group (here `myDockerResourceGroup`) along with the template URI:

```
azure group create --name myDockerResourceGroup --location "West US" \
  --template-uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/master/docker-simple-on-ubuntu/azuredeploy.json
```

Answer the prompts for naming your storage account, DNS name, username, etc. and then give it a few minutes to finish the deployment. You should see output similar to the following:

```
info:    Executing command group create
+ Getting resource group myDockerResourceGroup
+ Updating resource group myDockerResourceGroup
info:    Updated resource group myDockerResourceGroup
info:    Supply values for the following parameters
newStorageAccountName: mydockerstorage
adminUsername: ops
adminPassword: P@ssword!
dnsNameForPublicIP: mydockergroup
+ Initializing template configurations and parameters
+ Creating a deployment
info:    Created template deployment "azuredeploy"
data:    Id:                  /subscriptions/guid/resourceGroups/myDockerResourceGroup
data:    Name:                myDockerResourceGroup
data:    Location:            westus
data:    Provisioning State:  Succeeded
data:    Tags: null
data:
info:    group create command OK

```

## Deploy your first nginx container
Once the deployment has finished, SSH to your new Docker host using the DNS name you provided during deployment. Let's try to run an nginx container:

```
sudo docker run -d -p 80:80 nginx
```

You should see output similar to the following:

```
Unable to find image 'nginx:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/nginx
efd26ecc9548: Pull complete
a3ed95caeb02: Pull complete
a48df1751a97: Pull complete
8ddc2d7beb91: Pull complete
Digest: sha256:2ca2638e55319b7bc0c7d028209ea69b1368e95b01383e66dfe7e4f43780926d
Status: Downloaded newer image for nginx:latest
b6ed109fb743a762ff21a4606dd38d3e5d35aff43fa7f12e8d4ed1d920b0cd74
```

Examine the container running on your host using `sudo docker ps`:

```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED              STATUS              PORTS                         NAMES
b6ed109fb743        nginx               "nginx -g 'daemon off"   About a minute ago   Up About a minute   0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp, 443/tcp   adoring_payne
```

To see your container in action, open up a web browser and enter the DNS name you specified during deployment:

![Running ngnix container](./media/virtual-machines-linux-dockerextension/nginxrunning.png)

You may wish to configure the Docker daemon TCP port, security, or deploy containers using Docker Compose. See the [Azure Virtual Machine Extension for Docker GitHub project](https://github.com/Azure/azure-docker-extension/) for more information.

## Docker VM Extension JSON template reference
This example used a quick-start template. To deploy the Azure Docker VM extension with your own Resource Manager templates, add the following:

```
{
  "type": "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/extensions",
  "name": "[concat(variables('vmName'), '/DockerExtension'))]",
  "apiVersion": "2015-05-01-preview",
  "location": "[parameters('location')]",
  "dependsOn": [
    "[concat('Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/', variables('vmName'))]"
  ],
  "properties": {
    "publisher": "Microsoft.Azure.Extensions",
    "type": "DockerExtension",
    "typeHandlerVersion": "1.1",
    "autoUpgradeMinorVersion": true,
    "settings": {},
    "protectedSettings": {}
  }
}
```
