# Azure hybrid cloud test environments
For dev/test or a proof-of-concept, hybrid cloud test environments use your local Internet connection and one of your public IP addresses and step you through setting up a functioning, cross-premises Azure Virtual Network (VNet). When you are finished, you can develop and test applications, experiment with simplified IT workloads, and gauge the performance of a site-to-site virtual private network (VPN) connection relative to your location on the Internet.

## Hybrid cloud base configuration
The [hybrid cloud base configuration](virtual-machines-windows-ps-hybrid-cloud-test-env-base.md) consists of:

* A simplified on-premises network with four virtual machines (a domain controller, an application server, a client computer, and a VPN device running Windows Server and Routing and Remote Access)
* An Azure virtual network with a replica domain controller
* A site-to-site VPN connection

## SharePoint intranet farm in a hybrid cloud
The [SharePoint intranet farm in a hybrid cloud test environment](virtual-machines-windows-ps-hybrid-cloud-test-env-sp.md) adds a SQL Server 2014 server and a SharePoint Server 2013 server to the hybrid cloud base configuration. This creates a two-tier SharePoint farm that you can access from the client computer on the simplified on-premises network.

## Web-based line-of-business (LOB) application in a hybrid cloud
The [web-based LOB application in a hybrid cloud test environment](virtual-machines-windows-ps-hybrid-cloud-test-env-lob.md) adds a SQL Server 2014 server and an Internet Information Services (IIS) server to the hybrid cloud base configuration. This creates the infrastructure in which you can deploy and test a tiered, web-based LOB application.

## Office 365 Directory Synchronization (DirSync) server in a hybrid cloud
The [Office 365 DirSync server in a hybrid cloud test environment](virtual-machines-windows-ps-hybrid-cloud-test-env-dirsync.md) adds a DirSync server to the hybrid cloud base configuration and demonstrates Office 365 DirSync with password synchronization to a trial Office 365 subscription.

## Simulated hybrid cloud test environment
For organizations and individuals for which a direct Internet connection and public IP address are not readily available, the [simulated hybrid cloud test environment](virtual-machines-windows-ps-hybrid-cloud-test-env-sim.md) builds out the simplified on-premises network in a separate Azure Virtual Network and then connects the two virtual networks with a VNet-to-VNet VPN connection.
