# How to connect and log on to an Azure virtual machine running Windows
You'll use the **Connect** button in the Azure portal to start a Remote Desktop (RDP) session. First you connect to the virtual machine, then you log on.

## Connect to the virtual machine
1. If you haven't already done so, sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
2. On the Hub menu, click **Virtual Machines**.
3. Select the virtual machine from the list.
4. On the blade for the virtual machine, click **Connect**.

   > [!TIP]
   > If the **Connect** button in the portal is greyed out and you are not connected to Azure via an [Express Route](../expressroute/expressroute-introduction.md) or [Site-to-Site VPN](../vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-howto-site-to-site-resource-manager-portal.md) connection, you need to create and assign your VM a public IP address before you can use RDP. You can read more about [public IP addresses in Azure](../virtual-network/virtual-network-ip-addresses-overview-arm.md).
