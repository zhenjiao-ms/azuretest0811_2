# How to tag a Linux virtual machine in Azure
This article describes different ways to tag a Linux virtual machine in Azure through the Resource Manager deployment model. Tags are user-defined key/value pairs which can be placed directly on a resource or a resource group. Azure currently supports up to 15 tags per resource and resource group. Tags may be placed on a resource at the time of creation or added to an existing resource. Please note, tags are supported for resources created via the Resource Manager deployment model only.

[!INCLUDE [virtual-machines-common-tag](../../includes/virtual-machines-common-tag.md)]

## Tagging with Azure CLI
To begin, [install and configure the Azure CLI](../xplat-cli-azure-resource-manager.md) and make sure you are in Resource Manager mode (`azure config mode arm`).

You can view all properties for a given Virtual Machine, including the tags, using this command:

        azure vm show -g MyResourceGroup -n MyTestVM

To add a new VM tag through the Azure CLI, you can use the `azure vm set` command along with the tag parameter **-t**:

        azure vm set -g MyResourceGroup -n MyTestVM –t myNewTagName1=myNewTagValue1;myNewTagName2=myNewTagValue2

To remove all tags, you can use the **–T** parameter in the `azure vm set` command.

        azure vm set – g MyResourceGroup –n MyTestVM -T


Now that we have applied tags to our resources Azure CLI and the Portal, let’s take a look at the usage details to see the tags in the billing portal.
