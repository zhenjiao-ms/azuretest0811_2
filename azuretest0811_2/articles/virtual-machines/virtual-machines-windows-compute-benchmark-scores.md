# Compute benchmark scores for Windows VMs
The following SPECInt benchmark scores show compute performance for Azure's high performance VM lineup running Windows Server. Compute benchmark scores are also available for [Linux VMs](virtual-machines-linux-compute-benchmark-scores.md).

## A-series - compute-intensive
| Size | vCPUs | NUMA nodes | CPU | Runs | Avg base rate | StdDev |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Standard_A8 |8 |1 |Intel Xeon CPU E5-2670 0 @ 2.6 GHz |10 |236.1 |1.1 |
| Standard_A9 |16 |2 |Intel Xeon CPU E5-2670 0 @ 2.6 GHz |10 |450.3 |7.0 |
| Standard_A10 |8 |1 |Intel Xeon CPU E5-2670 0 @ 2.6 GHz |5 |235.6 |0.9 |

## About SPECint
Windows numbers were computed by running [SPECint 2006](https://www.spec.org/cpu2006/results/rint2006.html) on Windows Server. SPECint was run using the base rate option (SPECint_rate2006), with one copy per core. SPECint consists of 12 separate tests, each run three times, taking the median value from each test and weighting them to form a composite score.  Those were then run across multiple VMs to provide the average scores shown.
