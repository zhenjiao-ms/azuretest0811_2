This topic describes how to use **ssh-keygen** and **openssl** on Linux and Mac to create and use **ssh-rsa** format and **.pem** format files to secure communication with Azure VMs based on Linux. Creating Linux-based Azure Virtual Machines using the Resource Manager deployment model is recommended for new deployments and takes an *ssh-rsa* type public key file or string (depending on the deployment client). The [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) currently accepts only the **ssh-rsa** format strings, whether for classic or Resource Manager deployments.

## Which files do you need?
A basic ssh setup for Azure includes an **ssh-rsa** public and private key pair of 2048 bits (by default, **ssh-keygen** stores these files as **~/.ssh/id_rsa** and **~/.ssh/id-rsa.pub** unless you change the defaults) as well as a `.pem` file generated from the **id_rsa** private key file for use with the classic deployment model of the classic portal. 

Here are the deployment scenarios, and the types of files you use in each:

1. **ssh-rsa** keys are required for any deployment using the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), regardless of the deployment model.
2. .pem file are required to create VMs using the [classic portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com). .pem files are also supported in classic deployments that use the [Azure CLI](../xplat-cli-install.md). 

## Create keys for use with SSH
If you already have SSH keys, pass the public key file when creating your Azure VM. 

If you need to create the files:

1. Make sure your implementation of **ssh-keygen** and **openssl** is up to date. This varies by platform. 
   
   * For Mac, be sure to visit the [Apple Product Security web site](https://support.apple.com/HT201222) and choose the proper updates if necessary.
   * For Debian-based Linux distributions such as Ubuntu, Debian, Mint, and so on:
     
           sudo apt-get install --upgrade-only openssl
   * For RPM-based Linux distributions such as CentOS and Oracle Linux:
     
           sudo yum update openssl
   * For SLES and OpenSUSE
     
           sudo zypper update openssl
2. Use **ssh-keygen** to create a 2048-bit RSA public and private key files, and unless you have a specific location or specific names for the files, accept the default location and name of `~/.ssh/id_rsa`. The basic command is:
   
        ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 
   
    Typically, your **ssh-keygen** implementation adds a comment, often the username and host name of the computer. You can specify a specific comment using the `-C` option.
3. Create a .pem file from your `~/.ssh/id_rsa` file to enable you to work with the classic portal. Use the **openssl** as follows:
   
        openssl req -x509 -key ~/.ssh/id_rsa -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -out myCert.pem
   
    If you want to create a .pem file from a different private key file, modify the `-key` argument. 

> [!NOTE]
> If you plan to manage services deployed with the classic deployment model, you may also want to create a **.cer** format file to upload to the portal -- although this doesn't involve **ssh** or connecting to Linux VMS, which is the subject of this article. To convert your .pem file into a DER encoded X509 certificate file on Linux or Mac, type:
> <br />
> openssl  x509 -outform der -in myCert.pem -out myCert.cer
> 
> 

## Use SSH keys you already have
You can use ssh-rsa (`.pub`) keys for all new work, especially with the Resource Manager deployment model and the preview portal; you may need to create a `.pem` file from your keys if you need to use the classic portal.

## Create a VM with your public key file
Once you've created the files you need, there are many ways to create a VM to which you can securely connect using a public-private key exchange. In almost all situations, especially using Resource Manager deployments, pass the .pub file when prompted for an ssh key file path or the contents of a file as a string. 

### Example: Creating a VM with the id_rsa.pub file
The most common usage is when imperatively creating a VM -- or uploading a template to create a VM. The following code example shows creating a new, secure Linux VM in Azure by passing the public file name (in this case, the default `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` file) to the `azure vm create` command. (The other arguments, such as resource group and storage account, were previously created.). This example uses the Resource Manager deployment method, so ensure your Azure CLI is set accordingly with `azure config mode arm`:

    azure vm create \
    --nic-name testnic \
    --public-ip-name testpip \
    --vnet-name testvnet \
    --vnet-subnet-name testsubnet \
    --storage-account-name computeteststore 
    --image-urn canonical:UbuntuServer:14.04.4-LTS:latest \
    --username ops \
    -ssh-publickey-file ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub \
    testrg testvm westeurope linux

The next example shows the use of the **ssh-rsa** format with a Resource Manager template and the Azure CLI to create an Ubuntu VM that is secured by a username and the contents of the `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` as a string. (In this case, the public key string is shortened to be more readable.) 

    azure group deployment create \
    --resource-group test-sshtemplate \
    --template-uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/master/101-vm-sshkey/azuredeploy.json \

### Example: Creating a VM with a .pem file
You can then use the .pem file with either the classic portal or with the classic deployment mode (`azure config mode asm`) and `azure vm create`, as in the following example:

    azure vm create \
    -l "West US" -n testpemasm \
    -P -t myCert.pem -e 22 \
    testpemasm \
    b39f27a8b8c64d52b05eac6a62ebad85__Ubuntu-14_04_4-LTS-amd64-server-20160406-en-us-30GB \
    ops
    info:    Executing command vm create
    warn:    --vm-size has not been specified. Defaulting to "Small".
    + Looking up image b39f27a8b8c64d52b05eac6a62ebad85__Ubuntu-14_04_4-LTS-amd64-server-20160406-en-us-30GB
    + Looking up cloud service

    + Creating cloud service
    + Retrieving storage accounts
    + Configuring certificate

    info:    vm create command OK


## Connect to your VM
The **ssh** command takes a username to log on with, the network address of the computer, and the port at which to connect to the address -- as well as many other special variations. (For more information about **ssh**, you might start with this [article on Secure Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell)) 

A typical usage with Resource Manager deployment might look like the following, if you've merely specified a subdomain and a deployment location:

    ssh user@subdomain.westus.cloudapp.azure.com -p 22

or, if you are connecting to a classic deployment cloud service the address you would use might look like this:

    ssh user@subdomain.cloudapp.net -p 22

Because the address form can change -- you can always use the IP address or perhaps you have a custom domain name assigned -- you'll need to discover the address of your Azure VM. 

### Discovering your Azure VM SSH address with classic deployments
You can discover the address to use with a VM and the classic deployment model by using the `azure vm show` command with the VM name:

    azure vm show testpemasm
    info:    Executing command vm show
    + Getting virtual machines
    data:    DNSName "testpemasm.cloudapp.net"
    data:    Location "West US"

If you didn't use the default SSH port of 22 when you created the VM, you can discover what ports have inbound rules with the `azure network nsg show` command, like the following example:

    azure network nsg show testrg testnsg
    info:    Executing command network nsg show
    + Looking up the network security group "testnsg"

### Example: Output of SSH session using .pem keys and classic deployment
If you created a VM using a .pem file created from your `~/.ssh/id_rsa` file, you can directly ssh into that VM. Note that when you do, the certificate handshake will use your private key at `~/.ssh/id_rsa`. (The VM creation process computes the public key from the .pem and places the ssh-rsa form of the public key in `~/.ssh/authorized_users`.) Connecting might look like the following example:

    ssh ops@testpemasm.cloudapp.net -p 22
    The authenticity of host 'testpemasm.cloudapp.net (40.83.178.221)' can't be established.
    RSA key fingerprint is dc:bb:e4:cc:59:db:b9:49:dc:71:a3:c8:37:36:fd:62.
    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
    Warning: Permanently added 'testpemasm.cloudapp.net,40.83.178.221' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
