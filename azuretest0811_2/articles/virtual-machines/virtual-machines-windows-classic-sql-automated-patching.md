# Automated Patching for SQL Server in Azure Virtual Machines (Classic)

Automated Patching establishes a maintenance window for an Azure Virtual Machine running SQL Server. Automated Updates can only be installed during this maintenance window. For SQL Server, this ensures that system updates and any associated restarts occur at the best possible time for the database. Automated Patching depends on the [SQL Server IaaS Agent Extension](virtual-machines-windows-classic-sql-server-agent-extension.md).

[!INCLUDE [learn-about-deployment-models](../../includes/learn-about-deployment-models-classic-include.md)] To view the Resource Manager version of this article, see [Automated Patching for SQL Server in Azure Virtual Machines Resource Manager](virtual-machines-windows-sql-automated-patching.md).

## Prerequisites
To use Automated Patching, consider the following prerequisites:

**Operating System**:

* Windows Server 2012
* Windows Server 2012 R2

**SQL Server version**:

* SQL Server 2012
* SQL Server 2014
* SQL Server 2016

**Azure PowerShell**:

* [Install the latest Azure PowerShell commands](../powershell-install-configure.md) if you plan to configure Automated Patching with PowerShell.

> [!NOTE]
> Automated Patching relies on the SQL Server IaaS Agent Extension. Current SQL virtual machine gallery images add this extension by default. For more information, see [SQL Server IaaS Agent Extension](virtual-machines-windows-classic-sql-server-agent-extension.md).

## Settings
The following table describes the options that can be configured for Automated Patching. The actual configuration steps vary depending on whether you use the Azure portal or Azure Windows PowerShell commands.

| Setting | Possible values | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Automated Patching** |Enable/Disable (Disabled) |Enables or disables Automated Patching for an Azure virtual machine. |
| **Maintenance schedule** |Everyday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday |The schedule for downloading and installing Windows, SQL Server, and Microsoft updates for your virtual machine. |
| **Maintenance start hour** |0-24 |The local start time to update the virtual machine. |
| **Maintenance window duration** |30-180 |The number of minutes permitted to complete the download and installation of updates. |
| **Patch Category** |Important |The category of updates to download and install. |

## Configuration in the Portal
You can use the Azure Portal to configure Automated Patching during provisioning or for existing VMs.

### New VMs
Use the Azure Portal to configure Automated Patching when you create a new SQL Server Virtual Machine in the classic deployment model.

The following Azure portal screenshot shows these options under **OPTIONAL CONFIGURATION** | **SQL AUTOMATED PATCHING**.

### Existing VMs
For existing SQL Server 2012 or 2014 virtual machines, select the **Auto patching** settings in the **Configuration** section of the virtual machine properties. In the **Automated patching** window, you can enable the feature, set the maintenance schedule and start hour, and choose the maintenance window duration. This is shown in the following screenshot.

> [!NOTE]
> When you enable Automated Patching for the first time, Azure configures the SQL Server IaaS Agent in the background. During this time, the Azure portal might not show that Automated Patching is configured. Wait several minutes for the agent to be installed, configured. After that the Azure portal will reflect the new settings.

## Configuration with PowerShell
You can also use PowerShell to configure Automated Patching.

In the following example, PowerShell is used to configure Automated Patching on an existing SQL Server VM. The **New-AzureVMSqlServerAutoPatchingConfig** command configures a new maintenance window for automatic updates.

    $aps = New-AzureVMSqlServerAutoPatchingConfig -Enable -DayOfWeek "Thursday" -MaintenanceWindowStartingHour 11 -MaintenanceWindowDuration 120  -PatchCategory "Important"

    Get-AzureVM -ServiceName <vmservicename> -Name <vmname> | Set-AzureVMSqlServerExtension -AutoPatchingSettings $aps | Update-AzureVM

Based on this example, the following table describes the practical effect on the target Azure VM:

| Parameter | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| **DayOfWeek** |Patches installed every Thursday. |
| **MaintenanceWindowStartingHour** |Begin updates at 11:00am. |
| **MaintenanceWindowsDuration** |Patches must be installed within 120 minutes. Based on the start time, they must complete by 1:00pm. |
| **PatchCategory** |The only possible setting for this parameter is “Important”. |

It could take several minutes to install and configure the SQL Server IaaS Agent.

To disable Automated Patching, run the same script without the -Enable parameter to the New-AzureVMSqlServerAutoPatchingConfig. As with installation, it can take several minutes to disable Automated Patching.
