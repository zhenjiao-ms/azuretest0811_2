# Run NAMD with Microsoft HPC Pack on Linux compute nodes in Azure
This article shows you how to deploy a Microsoft HPC Pack cluster on Azure with multiple Linux compute nodes and run a [NAMD](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/) job with **charmrun** to calculate and visualize the structure of a large biomolecular system.

[!INCLUDE [learn-about-deployment-models](../../includes/learn-about-deployment-models-both-include.md)].

NAMD (for Nanoscale Molecular Dynamics program) is a parallel molecular dynamics package designed for high-performance simulation of large biomolecular systems containing up to millions of atoms, such as viruses, cell structures, and large proteins. NAMD scales to hundreds of cores for typical simulations and to more than 500,000 cores for the largest simulations.

Microsoft HPC Pack provides features to run a variety of large-scale HPC and parallel applications, including MPI applications, on clusters of Microsoft Azure virtual machines. Originally developed as a solution for Windows HPC workloads, HPC Pack now supports running Linux HPC applications on Linux compute node VMs deployed in an HPC Pack cluster. See [Get started with Linux compute nodes in an HPC Pack cluster in Azure](virtual-machines-linux-classic-hpcpack-cluster.md) for an introduction.

## Prerequisites
* **HPC Pack cluster with Linux compute nodes** - Deploy an HPC Pack cluster with Linux compute nodes on Azure using either an [Azure Resource Manager template](https://azure.microsoft.com/marketplace/partners/microsofthpc/newclusterlinuxcn/) or an [Azure PowerShell script](virtual-machines-linux-classic-hpcpack-cluster-powershell-script.md). See [Get started with Linux compute nodes in an HPC Pack cluster in Azure](virtual-machines-linux-classic-hpcpack-cluster.md) for the prerequisites and steps for either option. If you choose the PowerShell script deployment option, see the sample configuration file in the sample files at the end of this article to deploy an Azure-based HPC Pack cluster consisting of a Windows Server 2012 R2 head node and 4 size Large CentOS 6.6 compute nodes. Adapt this as needed for your environment.
* **NAMD software and tutorial files** - Download NAMD software for Linux from the [NAMD](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/) site (registration required). This article is based on NAMD version 2.10, and uses the [Linux-x86_64 (64-bit Intel/AMD with Ethernet)](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Development/Download/download.cgi?UserID=&AccessCode=&ArchiveID=1310) archive, which you'll use to run NAMD on multiple Linux compute nodes in a cluster network. Also download the [NAMD tutorial files](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Training/Tutorials/#namd). The downloads are .tar files, and you will need a Windows tool to extract the files on the cluster head node. Follow the instructions later in this article to do this. 
* **VMD** (optional) - To see the results of your NAMD job, download and install the molecular visualization program [VMD](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/) on a computer of your choice. The current version is 1.9.2. See the VMD download site to get started.  

## Set up mutual trust between compute nodes
Running a cross-node job on multiple Linux nodes requires the nodes to trust each other (by **rsh** or **ssh**). When you create the HPC Pack cluster with the Microsoft HPC Pack IaaS deployment script, the script automatically sets up permanent mutual trust for the administrator account you specify. For non-administrator users you create in the cluster's domain, you have to set up temporary mutual trust among the nodes when a job is allocated to them, and destroy the relationship after the job is complete. To do this for each user, provide an RSA key pair to the cluster which HPC Pack uses to establish the trust relationship. Instructions follow.

### Generate an RSA key pair
It's easy to generate an RSA key pair, which contains a public key and a private key, by running the Linux **ssh-keygen** command.

1. Log on to a Linux computer.
2. Run the following command.
   
   ```
   ssh-keygen -t rsa
   ```
   
   > [!NOTE]
   > Press **Enter** to use the default settings until the command is completed. Do not enter a passphrase here; when prompted for a password, just press **Enter**.
   > 
   > 
   
   ![Generate an RSA key pair](./media/virtual-machines-linux-classic-hpcpack-cluster-namd/keygen.png)
3. Change directory to the ~/.ssh directory. The private key is stored in id_rsa and the public key in id_rsa.pub.
   
   ![Private and public keys](./media/virtual-machines-linux-classic-hpcpack-cluster-namd/keys.png)

### Add the key pair to the HPC Pack cluster
1. Make a Remote Desktop connnection to your head node with your HPC Pack administrator account (the administrator account you set up when you deployed the cluster).
2. Use standard Windows Server procedures to create a domain user account in the cluster's Active Directory domain. For example, use the Active Directory User and Computers tool on the head node. The examples in this article assume you create a domain user named hpcuser in the hpclab domain (hpclab\hpcuser).
3. Add the domain user to the HPC Pack cluster as a cluster user. For instructions see [Add or remove cluster users](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/ff919330.aspx).
4. Create a file named C:\cred.xml and copy the RSA key data into it. You can find an example in the sample files at the end of this article.
   
   ```
   <ExtendedData>
     <PrivateKey>Copy the contents of private key here</PrivateKey>
     <PublicKey>Copy the contents of public key here</PublicKey>
   </ExtendedData>
   ```
5. Open a Command Prompt and enter the following command to set the credentials data for the hpclab\hpcuser account. You use the **extendeddata** parameter to pass the name of the C:\cred.xml file you created for the key data.
   
   ```
   hpccred setcreds /extendeddata:c:\cred.xml /user:hpclab\hpcuser /password:<UserPassword>
   ```
   
   This command completes successfully without output. After setting the credentials for the user accounts you need to run jobs, store the cred.xml file in a secure location, or delete it.
6. If you generated the RSA key pair on one of your Linux nodes, remember to delete the keys after you finish using them. HPC Pack does not set up mutual trust if it finds an existing id_rsa file or id_rsa.pub file.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We don’t recommend running a Linux job as a cluster administrator on a shared cluster, because a job submitted by an administrator runs under the root account on the Linux nodes. A job submitted by a non-administrator user runs under a local Linux user account with the same name as the job user, and HPC Pack sets up mutual trust for this Linux user across all the nodes allocated to the job. You can set up the Linux user manually on the Linux nodes before running the job, or HPC Pack creates the user automatically when the job is submitted. If HPC Pack creates the user, HPC Pack deletes it after the job completes. The keys are removed after job completion on the nodes to reduce security threats.

## Set up a file share for Linux nodes
Now set up an SMB file share, and mount the shared folder on all Linux nodes to allow the Linux nodes to access NAMD files with a common path. Following are steps to mount a shared folder on the head node, which is recommended for distributions such as CentOS 6.6 which currently don’t support the Azure File service. If your Linux nodes support an Azure File share, see [How to use Azure File Storage with Linux](../storage/storage-how-to-use-files-linux.md).  For additional file sharing options with HPC Pack, see [Get started with Linux compute nodes in an HPC Pack Cluster in Azure](virtual-machines-linux-classic-hpcpack-cluster.md).

1. Create a folder on the head node, and share it to Everyone by setting Read/Write privileges. In this example, \\\\CentOS66HN\Namd is the name of the folder, where CentOS66HN is the host name of the head node.
2. Create a subfolder named namd2 in the shared folder. In namd2 create another subfolder named namdsample.
3. Extract the NAMD files in the folder by using a Windows version of **tar** or another Windows utility that operates on .tar archives. 
   
   * Extract the NAMD tar archive to \\\\CentOS66HN\Namd\namd2.
   * Extract the tutorial files under \\\\CentOS66HN\Namd\namd2\namdsample.
4. Open a Windows PowerShell window and run the following commands to mount the shared folder on the Linux nodes.
   
    ```
    clusrun /nodegroup:LinuxNodes mkdir -p /namd2
   
    clusrun /nodegroup:LinuxNodes mount -t cifs //CentOS66HN/Namd/namd2 /namd2 -o vers=2.1`,username=<username>`,password='<password>'`,dir_mode=0777`,file_mode=0777
    ```

The first command creates a folder named /namd2 on all nodes in the LinuxNodes group. The second command mounts the shared folder //CentOS66HN/Namd/namd2 onto the folder with dir_mode and file_mode bits set to 777. The *username* and *password* in the command should be the credentials of a user on the head node.

> [!NOTE]
> The “\`” symbol in the second command is an escape symbol for PowerShell. “\`,” means the “,” (comma character) is a part of the command.
> 
> 

## Create a Bash script to run a NAMD job
Your NAMD job needs a *nodelist* file for **charmrun** to determine the number of nodes to use when starting NAMD processes. You'll use a Bash script that generates the nodelist file and runs **charmrun** with this nodelist file. You can then submit a NAMD job in HPC Cluster Manager that calls this script.

Using a text editor of your choice, create a Bash script in the /namd2 folder containing the NAMD program files and name it hpccharmrun.sh. You can simply copy the example provided in the sample files at the end of this article. 

> [!TIP]
> Save your script as a text file with Linux line endings (LF only, not CR LF). This ensures that it runs properly on the Linux nodes.
> 
> 

Following are details about what this bash script does. If you're doing a proof of concept and just want to run a NAMD job, save your hpccharmrun.sh script in the /namd2 folder on the file share and go to [Submit a NAMD job](#submit-a-namd-job).

1. Define some variables.
   
   ```
   #!/bin/bash
   
   # The path of this script
   SCRIPT_PATH="$( dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )"
   # Charmrun command
   CHARMRUN=${SCRIPT_PATH}/charmrun
   # Argument of ++nodelist
   NODELIST_OPT="++nodelist"
   # Argument of ++p
   NUMPROCESS="+p"
   ```
2. Get node information from the environment variables. $NODESCORES stores a list of split words from $CCP_NODES_CORES. $COUNT is the size of $NODESCORES.
   
   ```
   # Get node information from the environment variables
   NODESCORES=(${CCP_NODES_CORES})
   COUNT=${#NODESCORES[@]}
   ```    
   
   The format for the $CCP_NODES_CORES variable is as follows:
   
   ```
   <Number of nodes> <Name of node1> <Cores of node1> <Name of node2> <Cores of node2>…
   ```
   
   This lists the total number of nodes, node names, and number of cores on each node that are allocated to the job. For example, if the job needs 10 cores to run, the value of $CCP_NODES_CORES will be similar to:
   
   ```
   3 CENTOS66LN-00 4 CENTOS66LN-01 4 CENTOS66LN-03 2
   ```
3. If the $CCP_NODES_CORES variable is not set, just start **charmrun** directly. (This should only occur when you run this script directly on your Linux nodes.)
   
   ```
   if [ ${COUNT} -eq 0 ]
   then
     # CCP_NODES is_CORES is not found or is empty, so just run charmrun without nodelist arg.
     #echo ${CHARMRUN} $*
     ${CHARMRUN} $*
   ```
4. Or create a nodelist file for **charmrun**.
   
   ```
   else
     # Create the nodelist file
     NODELIST_PATH=${SCRIPT_PATH}/nodelist_$$
   
     # Write the head line
     echo "group main" > ${NODELIST_PATH}
   
     # Get every node name and number of cores and write into the nodelist file
     I=1
     while [ ${I} -lt ${COUNT} ]
     do
         echo "host ${NODESCORES[${I}]} ++cpus ${NODESCORES[$(($I+1))]}" >> ${NODELIST_PATH}
         let "I=${I}+2"
     done
   ```
5. Run **charmrun** with the nodelist file, get its return status, and remove the nodelist file at the end.
   
   ${CCP_NUMCPUS} is another environment variable set by the HPC Pack head node. It stores the number of total cores allocated to this job. We use it to specify the number of processes for charmrun.
   
   ```
   # Run charmrun with nodelist arg
   #echo ${CHARMRUN} ${NUMPROCESS}${CCP_NUMCPUS} ${NODELIST_OPT} ${NODELIST_PATH} $*
   ${CHARMRUN} ${NUMPROCESS}${CCP_NUMCPUS} ${NODELIST_OPT} ${NODELIST_PATH} $*
   
   RTNSTS=$?
   rm -f ${NODELIST_PATH}
   fi
   
   ```
6. Exit with the **charmrun** return status.
   
   ```
   exit ${RTNSTS}
   ```

Following is the information in the nodelist file, which the script will generate:

```
group main
host <Name of node1> ++cpus <Cores of node1>
host <Name of node2> ++cpus <Cores of node2>
…
```

For example:

```
group main
host CENTOS66LN-00 ++cpus 4
host CENTOS66LN-01 ++cpus 4
host CENTOS66LN-03 ++cpus 2
```

## Submit a NAMD job
Now you are ready to submit a NAMD job in HPC Cluster Manager.

1. Connect to your cluster head node and start HPC Cluster Manager.
2. In **Resource Management**, ensure that the Linux compute nodes are in the **Online** state. If they are not, select them and click **Bring Online**.
3. In **Job Management**, click **New Job**.
4. Enter a name for job such as *hpccharmrun*.
   
   ![New HPC job](./media/virtual-machines-linux-classic-hpcpack-cluster-namd/namd_job.png)
5. On the **Job Details** page, under **Job Resources**, select the type of resource as **Node** and set the **Minimum** to 3. In this example we'll run the job on 3 Linux nodes and each node has 4 cores.
   
   ![Job resources](./media/virtual-machines-linux-classic-hpcpack-cluster-namd/job_resources.png)
6. Click **Edit Tasks** in the left navigation, and then click **Add** to add a task to the job.    
7. On the **Task Details and I/O Redirection** page, set the following values.
   
   * **Command line** -
     `/namd2/hpccharmrun.sh ++remote-shell ssh /namd2/namd2 /namd2/namdsample/1-2-sphere/ubq_ws_eq.conf > /namd2/namd2_hpccharmrun.log`
     
     > [!TIP]
     > The preceding command line is a single command without line breaks. It will wrap to appear on several lines under **Command line**.
     > 
   * **Working directory** - /namd2
   * **Minimum** - 3
     
     ![Task details](./media/virtual-machines-linux-classic-hpcpack-cluster-namd/task_details.png)
     
     > [!NOTE]
     > You set the working directory here because **charmrun** tries to navigate to the same working directory on each node. If the working directory isn't set, HPC Pack starts the command in a randomly named folder created on one of the Linux nodes. This causes the following error on the other nodes:
     > `/bin/bash: line 37: cd: /tmp/nodemanager_task_94_0.mFlQSN: No such file or directory.` To avoid this, specify a folder path which can be accessed by all nodes as the working directory.
     > 
8. Click **OK** and then click **Submit** to run this job.
   
   By default, HPC Pack submits the job as your current logged-on user account. A dialog box might prompt you to enter the user name and password after you click **Submit**.
   
   ![Job credentials](./media/virtual-machines-linux-classic-hpcpack-cluster-namd/creds.png)
   
   Under some conditions HPC Pack remembers the user information you input before and won’t show this dialog box. To make HPC Pack show it again, enter the following in a Command window and then submit the job.
   
   ```
   hpccred delcreds
   ```
9. The job takes several minutes to finish.
10. Find the job log at \\<headnodeName>\Namd\namd2\namd2_hpccharmrun.log and the output files in \\<headnodeName>\Namd\namd2\namdsample\1-2-sphere\.
11. Optionally, start VMD to view your job results. The steps for visualizing the NAMD output files (in this case, a ubiquitin protein molecule in a water sphere) are beyond the scope of this article. See [NAMD Tutorial](http://www.life.illinois.edu/emad/biop590c/namd-tutorial-unix-590C.pdf) for details.
