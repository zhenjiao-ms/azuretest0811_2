# Upload a Windows VM image to Azure for Resource Manager deployments
This article shows you how to create and upload a Windows virtual hard disk (VHD) image so you can quickly create VMs. For more details about disks and VHDs in Azure, see [About disks and VHDs for virtual machines](virtual-machines-linux-about-disks-vhds.md).

## Prerequisites
This article assumes that you have:

* **An Azure subscription** - If you don't already have one, [open an Azure account for free](/pricing/free-trial/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F), or [activate MSDN subscriber benefits](/pricing/member-offers/msdn-benefits-details/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
* **Azure PowerShell version 1.4 or above** - If you don't already have it installed, read [How to install and configure Azure PowerShell](../powershell-install-configure.md).
* **A virtual machine running Windows** - There are many tools for creating virtual machines on-premises. For example, see [Install the Hyper-V Role and configure a virtual machine](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/hh846766.aspx). For information about which Windows operating systems are supported on Azure, see [Microsoft server software support for Microsoft Azure virtual machines](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2721672).

## Make sure that the VM is in the right file format
In Azure, you can only use [generation 1 virtual machines](http://blogs.technet.com/b/ausoemteam/archive/2015/04/21/deciding-when-to-use-generation-1-or-generation-2-virtual-machines-with-hyper-v.aspx) that are in the VHD file format. The VHD must be a fixed size and be a whole number of megabytes, that is, a number divisible by 8. The maximum size allowed for the VHD is 1,023 GB.

* If you have a Windows VM image in VHDX format, convert it to a VHD using either of the following:
  
  * Hyper-V: Open Hyper-V and select your local computer on the left. Then in the menu above it, click **Action** > **Edit Disk...**. Navigate through the screens by clicking **Next** and entering these options: *Path for your VHDX file* > **Convert** > **VHD** > **Fixed size** > *Path for the new VHD file*. Click **Finish** to close.
  * [Convert-VHD PowerShell cmdlet](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/hh848454.aspx): Read the blog post [Converting Hyper-V .vhdx to .vhd file formats](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/cbernier/2013/08/29/converting-hyper-v-vhdx-to-vhd-file-formats-for-use-in-windows-azure/) for more information.
* If you have a Windows VM image in the [VMDK file format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VMDK), convert it to a VHD by using the [Microsoft Virtual Machine Converter](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=42497). Read the blog [How to Convert a VMware VMDK to Hyper-V VHD](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/timomta/archive/2015/06/11/how-to-convert-a-vmware-vmdk-to-hyper-v-vhd.aspx) for more information.

## Prepare the VHD for upload
This section shows you how to generalize your Windows virtual machine. Sysprep removes all your personal account information, among other things. For details about Sysprep, see [How to Use Sysprep: An Introduction](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/bb457073.aspx).

1. Sign in to the Windows virtual machine.
2. Open the Command Prompt window as an administrator. Change the directory to **%windir%\system32\sysprep**, and then run `sysprep.exe`.
3. In the **System Preparation Tool** dialog box, do the following:
   
   1. In **System Cleanup Action**, select **Enter System Out-of-Box Experience (OOBE)**, and make sure that the **Generalize** check box is selected.
   2. In **Shutdown Options**, select **Shutdown**.
   3. Click **OK**.

## Log in to Azure
1. Open Azure PowerShell and sign in to your Azure account.
   
        Login-AzureRmAccount
   
    A pop-up window opens for you to enter your Azure account credentials.
2. Get the subscription IDs for your available subscriptions.
   
        Get-AzureRmSubscription
3. Set the correct subscription using the subscription ID.        
   
        Select-AzureRmSubscription -SubscriptionId "<subscriptionID>"

## Get the storage account
You need a storage account in Azure house the uploaded VM image. You can either use an existing storage account or create a new one. 

Show the available storage accounts.

        Get-AzureRmStorageAccount

If you want to use an existing storage account, proceed to the [Upload the VM image](#upload-the-vm-image-to-your-storage-account) section.

If you want to create a storage account, follow these steps:

1. Make sure that you have a resource group for this storage account. Find out all the resource groups that are in your subscription by using:
   
        Get-AzureRmResourceGroup
2. To create a resource group, use this command:
   
        New-AzureRmResourceGroup -Name <resourceGroupName> -Location "West US"
3. Create a storage account in this resource group by using the [New-AzureRmStorageAccount](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt607148.aspx) cmdlet:
   
        New-AzureRmStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName <resourceGroupName> -Name <storageAccountName> -Location "<location>" -SkuName "<skuName>" -Kind "Storage"

Valid values for -SkuName are:

* **Standard_LRS** - Locally redundant storage. 
* **Standard_ZRS** - Zone redundant storage.
* **Standard_GRS** - Geo redundant storage. 
* **Standard_RAGRS** - Read access geo redundant storage. 
* **Premium_LRS** - Premium locally redundant storage. 

## Upload the VM image to your storage account
Use the [Add-AzureRmVhd](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt603554.aspx) cmdlet to upload the image to a container in your storage account:

        $rgName = "<resourceGroupName>"
        $urlOfUploadedImageVhd = "<storageAccount>/<blobContainer>/<targetVHDName>.vhd"
        Add-AzureRmVhd -ResourceGroupName $rgName -Destination $urlOfUploadedImageVhd -LocalFilePath <localPathOfVHDFile>

Where:

* **storageAccount** is the name of the storage account for the image. 
* **blobContainer** is the blob container where you want to store your image. If an existing blob container with this name isn't found, it's created for you.
* **targetVHDName** is the name that you want to use for the uploaded VHD file.
* **localPathOfVHDFile** is the full path and name of the .vhd file on your local machine.

If successful, you get a response that looks similar to this:

        C:\> Add-AzureRmVhd -ResourceGroupName testUpldRG -Destination https://testupldstore2.blob.core.windows.net/testblobs/WinServer12.vhd -LocalFilePath "C:\temp\WinServer12.vhd"
        MD5 hash is being calculated for the file C:\temp\WinServer12.vhd.
        MD5 hash calculation is completed.
        Elapsed time for the operation: 00:03:35
        Creating new page blob of size 53687091712...
        Elapsed time for upload: 01:12:49

        LocalFilePath           DestinationUri
        -------------           --------------
        C:\temp\WinServer12.vhd https://testupldstore2.blob.core.windows.net/testblobs/WinServer12.vhd

This command may take a while to complete, depending on your network connection and the size of your VHD file.

## Create a virtual network
Create the vNet and subNet of the [virtual network](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview.md).

1. Replace the value of variables with your own information. Provide the address prefix for the subnet in CIDR format. Create the variables and the subnet.
   
        $rgName = "<resourceGroup>"
        $location = "<location>"
        $subnetName = "<subNetName>"
        $singleSubnet = New-AzureRmVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig -Name $subnetName -AddressPrefix <0.0.0.0/0>
2. Replace the value of **$vnetName** with a name for the virtual network. Provide the address prefix for the virtual network in CIDR format. Create the variable and the virtual network with the subnet.
   
        $vnetName = "<vnetName>"
        $vnet = New-AzureRmVirtualNetwork -Name $vnetName -ResourceGroupName $rgName -Location $locName -AddressPrefix <0.0.0.0/0> -Subnet $singleSubnet

## Create a public IP address and network interface
To enable communication with the virtual machine in the virtual network, you need a [public IP address](../virtual-network/virtual-network-ip-addresses-overview-arm.md) and a network interface.

1. Replace the value of **$ipName** with a name for the public IP address. Create the variable and the public IP address.
   
        $ipName = "<ipName>"
        $pip = New-AzureRmPublicIpAddress -Name $ipName -ResourceGroupName $rgName -Location $locName -AllocationMethod Dynamic
2. Replace the value of **$nicName** with a name for the network interface. Create the variable and the network interface.
   
        $nicName = "<nicName>"
        $nic = New-AzureRmNetworkInterface -Name $nicName -ResourceGroupName $rgName -Location $locName -SubnetId $vnet.Subnets[0].Id -PublicIpAddressId $pip.Id

## Create the VM
The following PowerShell script shows how to set up the virtual machine configurations and use the uploaded VM image as the source for the new installation.

> [!NOTE]
> The VM needs to be in the same storage account as the uploaded VHD file.
> 
> 

</br>

    #Create variables
    # Enter a new user name and password to use as the local administrator account for the remotely accessing the VM
    $cred = Get-Credential

    # Name of the storage account where the VHD file is and where the OS disk will be created
    $storageAccName = "<storageAccountName>"

    # Name of the virtual machine
    $vmName = "<vmName>"

    # Size of the virtual machine. See the VM sizes documentation for more information: https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-windows-sizes/
    $vmSize = "<vmSize>"

    # Computer name for the VM
    $computerName = "<computerName>"

    # Name of the disk that holds the OS
    $osDiskName = "<osDiskName>"

    #Get the storage account where the uploaded image is stored
    $storageAcc = Get-AzureRmStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName $rgName -AccountName $storageAccName

    #Set the VM name and size
    #Use "Get-Help New-AzureRmVMConfig" to know the available options for -VMsize
    $vmConfig = New-AzureRmVMConfig -VMName $vmName -VMSize $vmSize

    #Set the Windows operating system configuration and add the NIC
    $vm = Set-AzureRmVMOperatingSystem -VM $vmConfig -Windows -ComputerName $computerName -Credential $cred -ProvisionVMAgent -EnableAutoUpdate

    $vm = Add-AzureRmVMNetworkInterface -VM $vm -Id $nic.Id

    #Create the OS disk URI
    $osDiskUri = '{0}vhds/{1}-{2}.vhd' -f $storageAcc.PrimaryEndpoints.Blob.ToString(), $vmName.ToLower(), $osDiskName

    #Configure the OS disk to be created from the image (-CreateOption fromImage), and give the URL of the uploaded image VHD for the -SourceImageUri parameter
    #You set this variable when you uploaded the VHD
    $vm = Set-AzureRmVMOSDisk -VM $vm -Name $osDiskName -VhdUri $osDiskUri -CreateOption fromImage -SourceImageUri $urlOfUploadedImageVhd -Windows

    #Create the new VM
    New-AzureRmVM -ResourceGroupName $rgName -Location $location -VM $vm



When complete, you should see the newly created VM in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) under **Browse** > **Virtual machines**, or by using the following PowerShell commands:

    $vmList = Get-AzureRmVM -ResourceGroupName $rgName
    $vmList.Name
