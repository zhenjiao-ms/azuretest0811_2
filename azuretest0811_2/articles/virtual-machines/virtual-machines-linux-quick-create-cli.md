# Create a Linux VM on Azure using the CLI
This article shows how to quickly deploy a Linux Virtual Machine on Azure using the Azure CLI's `azure vm quick-create` command. The `quick-create` command deploys a VM with a basic infrastructure surrounding it that you can use to prototype or test a concept very rapidly (you can think of it as the quickest way to a Linux bash shell).  The article requires an Azure account ([get a free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/)), and [the Azure CLI](../xplat-cli-install.md) logged in (`azure login`) and in resource manager mode (`azure config mode arm`).  You can also quickly deploy a Linux VM using the [Azure Portal](virtual-machines-linux-quick-create-portal.md).

## Quick Command Summary
One command to deploy a CoreOS VM and attach your SSH key:

```bash
azure vm quick-create -M ~/.ssh/azure_id_rsa.pub -Q CoreOS
```

## Deploy the Linux VM
Using the same command from above, the following shows each prompt along with the output you should expect to see, but uses the RHEL alias to create a RedHat Enteprise Linux 7.2 VM.  

## Use an ImageURN alias
The Azure CLI `quick-create` command has aliases mapped to the most common OS distributions. The following table lists the distribution aliases (as of Azure CLI version 0.10).  All deployments using `quick-create` default to SSD storage backed VMs, offering a high performance experience.

| Alias | Publisher | Offer | SKU | Version |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |:--- |:--- |
| CentOS |OpenLogic |Centos |7.2 |latest |
| CoreOS |CoreOS |CoreOS |Stable |latest |
| Debian |credativ |Debian |8 |latest |
| openSUSE |SUSE |openSUSE |13.2 |latest |
| RHEL |Redhat |RHEL |7.2 |latest |
| SLES |SLES |SLES |12-SP1 |latest |
| UbuntuLTS |Canonical |UbuntuServer |14.04.4-LTS |latest |

For the **ImageURN** option (`-Q`) we will use  `RHEL` to deploy a RedHat Enterprise Linux 7.2 VM. (These 7 aliases represent a tiny portion of the available OS on Azure; find more images in the marketplace by [searching for an image](virtual-machines-linux-cli-ps-findimage.md), or you can [upload your own custom image](virtual-machines-linux-create-upload-generic.md).)

In the following command walk through, please replace the prompts with values from your own environment, we are using "example" values.  

Follow the prompts and enter your own names

```bash
azure vm quick-create -M ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub -Q RHEL
```

The output should look like the following output block.

You can now SSH into your VM on the default SSH port 22 and the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) listed in the output above. (You can also use the IP address listed.)

```bash
ssh ops@rhel-westu-1630678171-pip.westus.cloudapp.azure.com
```
The login process should look something like the following:

```bash
The authenticity of host 'rhel-westu-1630678171-pip.westus.cloudapp.azure.com (104.42.236.196)' can't be established.

Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes

## Next Steps
The `azure vm quick-create` is the way to quickly deploy a VM so you can log in  to a bash shell and get working. Using `vm quick-create` does not give you the additional benefits of a complex environment.  To deploy a Linux VM customized for your infrastructure you can follow any of the articles below.

* [Use an Azure resource manager template to create a specific deployment](virtual-machines-linux-cli-deploy-templates.md)
* [Create your own custom environment for a Linux VM using Azure CLI commands directly](virtual-machines-linux-create-cli-complete.md).
* [Create a SSH Secured Linux VM on Azure using Templates](virtual-machines-linux-create-ssh-secured-vm-from-template.md)

Those articles will get you started in building an Azure infrastructure as well as any number of proprietary and open-source infrastructure deployment, configuration, and orchestration tools.
