# Attach a data disk to a Windows virtual machine created with the classic deployment model
[!INCLUDE [learn-about-deployment-models](../../includes/learn-about-deployment-models-classic-include.md)] Learn how to [perform these steps using the Resource Manager model](virtual-machines-windows-attach-disk-portal.md).

If you need an additional data disk, you can attach an empty disk or an existing disk with data to a VM. In both cases, the disks are .vhd files that reside in an Azure storage account. In the case of a new disk, after you attach the disk, you'll also need to initialize it so it's ready for use by a Windows VM.

For more details about disks, see [About Disks and VHDs for Virtual Machines](virtual-machines-windows-about-disks-vhds.md).

## Video walkthrough
Here's a [video walkthrough](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/videos/attaching-a-data-disk-to-a-windows-vm/) of the steps in this tutorial.

[!INCLUDE [howto-attach-disk-windows-linux](../../includes/howto-attach-disk-windows-linux.md)]

## Initialize the disk
1. Connect to the virtual machine. For instructions, see [How to log on to a virtual machine running Windows Server](virtual-machines-windows-classic-connect-logon.md).
2. After you log on to the virtual machine, open **Server Manager**. In the left pane, select **File and Storage Services**.

3. Expand the menu and select **Disks**.
4. The **Disks** section lists the disks. In most cases, it will have disk 0, disk 1, and disk 2. Disk 0 is the operating system disk, disk 1 is the temporary disk, and disk 2 is the data disk you just attached to the VM. The new data disk will list the Partition as **Unknown**. Right-click the disk and select **Initialize**.
5. You're notified that all data will be erased when the disk is initialized. Click **Yes** to acknowledge the warning and initialize the disk. Once complete, the Partion will be listed as **GPT**. Right-click the disk again and select **New Volume**.
6. Complete the wizard using the default values. When the wizard is done, the **Volumes** section lists the new volume. The disk is now online and ready to store data.

> [!NOTE]
> The size of the VM determines how many disks you can attach to it. For details, see [Sizes for virtual machines](virtual-machines-linux-sizes.md).
