# Redeploy virtual machine to new Azure node
If you have been facing difficulties troubleshooting Remote Desktop (RDP) connection or application access to Windows-based Azure virtual machine (VM), redeploying the VM may help. When you redeploy a VM, it moves the VM to a new node within the Azure infrastructure and then powers it back on, retaining all your configuration options and associated resources. This article shows you how to redeploy a VM using Azure PowerShell or the Azure portal.

> [!NOTE]
> After you redeploy a VM, the temporary disk will be lost and dynamic IP addresses associated with virtual network interface will be updated. 
> 
> 

## Using Azure PowerShell
Make sure you have the latest Azure PowerShell 1.x installed on your machine. Please read [How to install and configure Azure PowerShell](../powershell-install-configure.md) for more information.

Use this Azure PowerShell command to redeploy your virtual machine:

    Set-AzureRmVM -Redeploy -ResourceGroupName $rgname -Name $vmname

## Next steps
You can find specific help on [troubleshooting RDP connections](virtual-machines-windows-troubleshoot-rdp-connection.md) or [detailed RDP troubleshooting steps](virtual-machines-windows-detailed-troubleshoot-rdp.md) if you are having issues connecting to your VM. You can also read [application troubleshooting issues](virtual-machines-windows-troubleshoot-app-connection.md) if you cannot access an application running on your VM.
