# Get started with Linux compute nodes in an HPC Pack cluster in Azure
Set up a Microsoft HPC Pack cluster in Azure which contains a head node running Windows Server and several compute nodes running a supported Linux distribution. Explore options to move data among the Linux nodes and the Windows head node of the cluster. Learn how to submit Linux HPC jobs to the cluster.

[!INCLUDE [learn-about-deployment-models](../../includes/learn-about-deployment-models-both-include.md)].

At a high level the following diagram shows the HPC Pack cluster you'll create and work with.

![HPC Pack cluster with Linux nodes](./media/virtual-machines-linux-classic-hpcpack-cluster/scenario.png)

## Deploy an HPC Pack cluster with Linux compute nodes
Following are two recommended ways to create an HPC Pack cluster in Azure with Linux compute nodes:

* **Azure Resource Manager template** - Use a template from the Azure Marketplace, or a quickstart template from the commmunity, to automate creation of the cluster in the Resource Manager deployment model. For example, the [HPC Pack cluster for Linux workloads](https://azure.microsoft.com/marketplace/partners/microsofthpc/newclusterlinuxcn/) template in the Azure Marketplace creates a complete HPC Pack cluster infrastructure for Linux HPC workloads.
* **PowerShell script** - Use the [Microsoft HPC Pack IaaS deployment script](virtual-machines-windows-classic-hpcpack-cluster-powershell-script.md) (**New-HpcIaaSCluster.ps1**) to automate a complete cluster deployment in the classic deployment model. This Azure PowerShell script uses an HPC Pack VM image in the Azure Marketplace for fast deployment and provides a comprehensive set of configuration parameters to deploy Linux compute nodes.

For an overview of HPC Pack cluster deployment options in Azure, see [Options to create and manage a high peformance computing (HPC) cluster in Azure with Microsoft HPC Pack](virtual-machines-linux-hpcpack-cluster-options.md).

### Prerequisites
* **Azure subscription** - You can use a subscription in either the Azure Global or Azure China service. If you don't have an account, you can create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/) in just a couple of minutes.
* **Cores quota** - You might need to increase the quota of cores, especially if you choose to deploy several cluster nodes with multicore VM sizes. To increase a quota, open an online customer support request at no charge.
* **Linux distributions** - Currently HPC Pack supports the following Linux distributions for compute nodes. You can use Marketplace versions of these distributions where available, or supply your own.
  
  * CentOS-based: 6.5, 6.6, 6.7, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 6.5 HPC, 7.1 HPC
  * Red Hat Enterprise Linux: 6.7, 6.8, 7.2
  * SUSE Linux Enterprise Server: SLES 12, SLES 12 (Premium), SLES 12 for HPC, SLES 12 for HPC (Premium)
  * Ubuntu Server: 14.04 LTS, 16.04 LTS

    >[AZURE.TIP]To use the Azure RDMA network with size A8 and A9 compute node VMs, specify one of the SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 HPC or CentOS-based HPC images from the Marketplace. For more information, see [About the A8, A9, A10, and A11 compute-intensive instances](virtual-machines-linux-a8-a9-a10-a11-specs.md).

Additional prerequisites to deploy the cluster by using the HPC Pack IaaS deployment script:

* **Client computer** - You'll need a Windows-based client computer to run the cluster deployment script.
* **Azure PowerShell** - [Install and configure Azure PowerShell](../powershell-install-configure.md) (version 0.8.10 or later) on your client computer.
* **HPC Pack IaaS deployment script** - Download and unpack the latest version of the script from the [Microsoft Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=44949). You can check the version of the script by running `.\New-HPCIaaSCluster.ps1 –Version`. This article is based on version 4.4.1 or later of the script.

### Deployment option 1. Use a Resource Manager template
1. Go to the [HPC Pack cluster for Linux workloads](https://azure.microsoft.com/marketplace/partners/microsofthpc/newclusterlinuxcn/) template in the Azure Marketplace, and click **Deploy**.
2. In the Azure portal, review the information and then click **Create**.
   
    ![Portal creation](./media/virtual-machines-linux-classic-hpcpack-cluster/portal.png)
3. On the **Basics** blade, enter a name for the cluster, which will also name the head node VM. You can choose an existing resource group or create a new group for the deployment.
4. On the **Head node settings** blade, for a first deployment, you can generally accept the default settings. 
   
   > [!NOTE]
   > The **Post-configuration script URL** is an optional setting to specify a publicly available Windows PowerShell script that you want to run on the head node VM after it is running. 
   > 
5. On the **Compute node settings** blade, select a naming pattern for the nodes, the number and size of the nodes, and the Linux distribution to deploy.
6. On the **Infrastructure settings** blade, enter names for the virtual network and Active Directory domain for the cluster, domain and VM administrator credentials, and a naming pattern for the storage accounts needed for the cluster.
   
   > [!NOTE]
   > HPC Pack uses the Active Directory domain to authenticate cluster users. 
   > 
7. After the validation tests run and you review the terms of use, click **Purchase**.

### Deployment option 2. Use the IaaS deployment script
The HPC Pack IaaS deployment script uses an XML configuration file as input which describes the infrastructure of the HPC cluster. The following sample configuration file deploys a small cluster consisting of an HPC Pack head node and two size A7 CentOS 7.0 Linux compute nodes. Modify the file as needed for your environment and desired cluster configuration, and save it with a name such as HPCDemoConfig.xml. For example, you'll need to supply your subscription name and a unique storage account name and cloud service name, and you might want to choose a different supported Linux image for the compute nodes. For more information about the elements in the configuration file, see the Manual.rtf file in the script folder and [Create an HPC cluster with the HPC Pack IaaS deployment script](virtual-machines-windows-classic-hpcpack-cluster-powershell-script.md).

  </LinuxComputeNodes>
</IaaSClusterConfig>
```

**To run the HPC Pack IaaS deployment script**

1. Open the PowerShell console on the client computer as an administrator.
2. Change directory to the script folder (E:\IaaSClusterScript in this example).
   
    ```
    cd E:\IaaSClusterScript
    ```
3. Run the following command to deploy the HPC Pack cluster. This example assumes that the configuration file is located in E:\HPCDemoConfig.xml
   
    ```
    .\New-HpcIaaSCluster.ps1 –ConfigFile E:\HPCDemoConfig.xml –AdminUserName MyAdminName
    ```
   
    The script generates a log file automatically since  the **-LogFile** parameter isn't specified. The logs aren't written in real time, but are collected at the end of the validation and the deployment. If the PowerShell process is stopped while the script is running, some logs will be lost.
   
    a. Because the **AdminPassword** is not specified in the above command, you'll be prompted to enter the password for user *MyAdminName*.
   
    b. The script then starts to validate the configuration file. It can take up to several minutes depending on the network connection.
   
    ![Validation](./media/virtual-machines-linux-classic-hpcpack-cluster/validate.png)
   
    c. After validations pass, the script lists the resources which will be created for the HPC cluster. Enter *Y* to continue.
   
    ![Resources](./media/virtual-machines-linux-classic-hpcpack-cluster/resources.png)
   
    d. The script starts to deploy the HPC Pack cluster and completes the configuration without further manual steps. This can take several minutes.
   
    ![Deploy](./media/virtual-machines-linux-classic-hpcpack-cluster/deploy.png)

## Connect to the head node
After the deployment finishes successfully, [connect by Remote Desktop to the head node](virtual-machines-windows-connect-logon.md) using the domain credentials you provided when you deployed the cluster (for example, *hpc\clusteradmin*). 

On the head node, start HPC Cluster Manager to check the status of the HPC Pack cluster. You can manage and monitor Linux compute nodes the same way you work with Windows compute nodes. For example, you'll see the Linux nodes listed in **Resource Management** (these nodes are deployed with the **LinuxNode** template).

![Node Management](./media/virtual-machines-linux-classic-hpcpack-cluster/management.png)

You'll also see the Linux nodes in the **Heat Map** view.

![Heat map](./media/virtual-machines-linux-classic-hpcpack-cluster/heatmap.png)

## How to move data in a cluster with Linux nodes
You have several choices to move data among Linux nodes and the Windows head node of the cluster. Here are three common methods.

* **Azure File** - Exposes a managed SMB file share to store data files in Azure storage. Both Windows nodes and the Linux nodes can mount an Azure File share as a drive or folder at the same time even if they are deployed in different virtual networks.
* **Head node SMB share** - Mounts a standard Windows shared folder of the head node on Linux nodes.
* **Head node NFS server**  - Provides a file-sharing solution for a mixed Windows and Linux environment.

### Azure File storage
The [Azure File](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/files/) service exposes file shares using the standard SMB 2.1 protocol. Azure VMs and cloud services can share file data across application components via mounted shares, and on-premises applications can access file data in a share through the File storage API. 

For detailed steps to create an Azure File share and mount it on the head node, see [Get started with Azure File storage on Windows](../storage/storage-dotnet-how-to-use-files.md). To mount the Azure File share on the Linux nodes, see [How to use Azure File Storage with Linux](../storage/storage-how-to-use-files-linux.md). To set up persisting connections, see [Persisting connections to Microsoft Azure Files](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazurestorage/archive/2014/05/27/persisting-connections-to-microsoft-azure-files.aspx).

In the following example, create an Azure File share on a storage account. To mount the share on the head node, open a Command Prompt and enter the following commands:

```
> cmdkey /add:allvhdsje.file.core.windows.net /user:allvhdsje /pass:<storageaccountkey>
> net use Z: \\allvhdje.file.core.windows.net\rdma /persistent:yes
```

In this example, allvhdsje is your storage account name, storageaccountkey is your storage account key, and rdma is the Azure File share name. The Azure File share will be mounted onto Z: on your head node.

To mount the Azure File share on Linux nodes, run a **clusrun** command on the head node. **[Clusrun](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc947685.aspx)** is a useful HPC Pack tool to carry out administrative tasks on multiple nodes. (See also [Clusrun for Linux nodes](#Clusrun-for-Linux-nodes) in this article.)

Open a Windows PowerShell window and enter the following commands.

```
PS > clusrun /nodegroup:LinuxNodes mkdir -p /rdma

PS > clusrun /nodegroup:LinuxNodes mount -t cifs //allvhdsje.file.core.windows.net/rdma /rdma -o vers=2.1`,username=allvhdsje`,password=<storageaccountkey>'`,dir_mode=0777`,file_mode=0777
```

The first command creates a folder named /rdma on all nodes in the LinuxNodes group. The second command mounts the Azure File share allvhdsjw.file.core.windows.net/rdma onto the /rdma folder with dir and file mode bits set to 777. In the second command, allvhdsje is your storage account name and storageaccountkey is your storage account key.

> [!NOTE]
> The “\`” symbol in the second command is an escape symbol for PowerShell. “\`,” means that the “,” (comma character) is a part of the command.
> 
> 

### Head node share
Alternatively, mount a shared folder of the head node on Linux nodes. This is the simplest way to share files, but the head node and all Linux nodes have to be deployed in the same virtual network. Here are the steps.

1. Create a folder on the head node and share it to Everyone with Read/Write permissions. For example, share D:\OpenFOAM on the head node as \\CentOS7RDMA-HN\OpenFOAM. Here CentOS7RDMA-HN is the hostname of the head node.
   
    ![File share permissions](./media/virtual-machines-linux-classic-hpcpack-cluster/fileshare1.png)
   
    ![File sharing](./media/virtual-machines-linux-classic-hpcpack-cluster/fileshare2.png)
2. Open a Windows PowerShell window and run the following commands to mount the shared folder.

```
PS > clusrun /nodegroup:LinuxNodes mkdir -p /openfoam

PS > clusrun /nodegroup:LinuxNodes mount -t cifs //CentOS7RDMA-HN/OpenFOAM /openfoam -o vers=2.1`,username=<username>`,password='<password>'`,dir_mode=0777`,file_mode=0777
```

The first command creates a folder named /openfoam on all nodes in the LinuxNodes group. The second command mounts the shared folder //CentOS7RDMA-HN/OpenFOAM onto the folder with dir and file mode bits set to 777. The username and password in the command should be the username and password of a cluster user on the head node. (See [Add or remove cluster users](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/ff919330.aspx).)

> [!NOTE]
> The “\`” symbol in the second command is an escape symbol for PowerShell. “\`,” means that the “,” (comma character) is a part of the command.
> 
> 

### NFS server
The NFS service enables you to share and migrate files between computers running the Windows Server 2012 operating system using the SMB protocol and Linux-based computers using the NFS protocol. The NFS server and all other nodes have to be deployed in the same virtual network. It provides better compatibility with Linux nodes compared with an SMB share; for example, it supports file links.

1. To install and set up an NFS server, follow the steps in [Server for Network File System First Share End-to-End](http://blogs.technet.com/b/filecab/archive/2012/10/08/server-for-network-file-system-first-share-end-to-end.aspx).
   
    For example, create an NFS share named nfs with the following properties.
   
    ![NFS authorization](./media/virtual-machines-linux-classic-hpcpack-cluster/nfsauth.png)
   
    ![NFS share permissions](./media/virtual-machines-linux-classic-hpcpack-cluster/nfsshare.png)
   
    ![NFS NTFS permissions](./media/virtual-machines-linux-classic-hpcpack-cluster/nfsperm.png)
   
    ![NFS management properties](./media/virtual-machines-linux-classic-hpcpack-cluster/nfsmanage.png)
2. Open a Windows PowerShell window and run the following commands to mount the NFS share.
   
   ```
   PS > clusrun /nodegroup:LinuxNodes mkdir -p /nfsshare
   PS > clusrun /nodegroup:LinuxNodes mount CentOS7RDMA-HN:/nfs /nfsshared
   ```
   
   The first command creates a folder named /nfsshared on all nodes in the LinuxNodes group. The second command mounts the NFS share CentOS7RDMA-HN:/nfs onto the folder. Here CentOS7RDMA-HN:/nfs is the remote path of your NFS share.

## How to submit jobs
There are several ways to submit jobs to the HPC Pack cluster:

* HPC Cluster Manager or HPC Job Manager GUI
* HPC web portal
* REST API

Job submission to the cluster in Azure via HPC Pack GUI tools and the HPC web portal are the same as for Windows compute nodes. See [HPC Pack Job Manager](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/ff919691.aspx) and [How to submit jobs from an on-premises client computer](virtual-machines-windows-hpcpack-cluster-submit-jobs.md).

To submit jobs via the REST API, refer to [Creating and Submitting Jobs by Using the REST API in Microsoft HPC Pack](http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/7737.creating-and-submitting-jobs-by-using-the-rest-api-in-microsoft-hpc-pack-windows-hpc-server.aspx). Also refer to the Python sample in the [HPC Pack SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=47756) to submit jobs from a Linux client.

## Clusrun for Linux nodes
The HPC Pack **clusrun** tool can be used to execute commands on Linux nodes either through a Command Prompt or HPC Cluster Manager. Following are some basic examples.

* Show current user names on all nodes in the cluster.
  
    ```
    > clusrun whoami
    ```
* Install the **gdb** debugger tool with **yum** on all nodes in the linuxnodes group and then restart the nodes after 10 minutes.
  
    ```
    > clusrun /nodegroup:linuxnodes yum install gdb –y; shutdown –r 10
    ```
* Create a shell script displaying each number 1 through 10 for one second on each Linux node in the cluster, run it, and show output from the nodes immediately.
  
    ```
    > clusrun /interleaved /nodegroup:linuxnodes echo \"for i in {1..10}; do echo \\\"\$i\\\"; sleep 1; done\" ^> script.sh; chmod +x script.sh; ./script.sh
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> You might need to use certain escape characters in **clusrun** commands. As shown in this example, use ^ in a Command Prompt to escape the ">" symbol.
> 
> 

## Next steps
* Try scaling up the cluster to a larger number of nodes, or try running a Linux workload on the cluster. For an example, see [Run NAMD with Microsoft HPC Pack on Linux compute nodes in Azure](virtual-machines-linux-classic-hpcpack-cluster-namd.md).
* Try a cluster with size [A8 or A9](virtual-machines-windows-a8-a9-a10-a11-specs.md) compute nodes to run MPI workloads. For an example, see [Run OpenFOAM with Microsoft HPC Pack on a Linux RDMA cluster in Azure](virtual-machines-linux-classic-hpcpack-cluster-openfoam.md).
* If you are interested in working with Linux nodes in an on-premises HPC Pack cluster, see the [TechNet guidance](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt595803.aspx).
