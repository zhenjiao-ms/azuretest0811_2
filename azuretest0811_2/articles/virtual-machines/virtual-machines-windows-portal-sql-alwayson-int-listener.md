# Configure an internal load balancer for an AlwaysOn availability group in Azure
This topic explains how to create an internal load balancer for a SQL Server AlwaysOn availability group in Azure virtual machines running in resource manager model. An AlwaysOn availability group requires a load balancer when the SQL Server instances are on Azure virtual machines. The load balancer stores the IP address for the availability group listener. If an availability group spans mutliple regions, each region needs a load balancer.

To complete this task, you need to have a SQL Server AlwaysOn availability group deployed on Azure virtual machines in resource manager model. Both SQL Server virtual machines must belong to the same availability set. You can use the [Microsoft template](virtual-machines-windows-portal-sql-alwayson-availability-groups.md) to automatically create the AlwaysOn availability group in Azure resource manager. This template automatically creates the internal load balancer for you. 

If you prefer, you can [manually configure an AlwaysOn availability group](virtual-machines-windows-portal-sql-alwayson-availability-groups-manual.md).

This topic requires that your availablity groups are already configured.  

Related topics include:

* [Configure AlwaysOn Availability Groups in Azure VM (GUI)](virtual-machines-windows-portal-sql-alwayson-availability-groups-manual.md)   
* [Configure a VNet-to-VNet connection by using Azure Resource Manager and PowerShell](../vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-vnet-vnet-rm-ps.md)

## Steps
By walking through this document you will create and configure a load balancer in the Azure portal. After that is complete, you will configure the cluster to use the IP address from the load balancer for the AlwaysOn availability group listener.

## Create and configure the load balancer in the Azure portal
In this portion of the task you will do the following steps in the Azure portal:

1. Create the load balancer and configure the IP address
2. Configure the backend pool
3. Create the probe 
4. Set the load balancing rules

> [!NOTE]
> If the SQL Servers are in different resource groups and regions, you will do all of these steps twice, once in each resource group.
> 
> 

## 1. Create the load balancer and configure the IP address
The first step is to create the load balancer. In the Azure portal, open the resource group that contains the SQL Server virtual machines. In the resource group, click **Add**.

* Search for **load balancer**. From the search results select **Load Balancer**, which is published by **Microsoft**.
* On the **Load Balancer** blade, click **Create**.
* On **Create load balancer**, configure the the load balancer as follows:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Name** |A text name representing the load balancer. For example, **sqlLB**. |
| **Schema** |**Internal** |
| **Virtual network** |Choose the virtual network that the SQL Servers are in. |
| **Subnet** |Choose the subnet that the SQL Servers are in. |
| **Subscription** |If you have multiple subscriptions, this field may appear. Select the subscription that you want associated with this resource. It is normally the same subcription as all of the resources for the availability group. |
| **Resource group** |Choose the resource group that the SQL Servers are in. |
| **Location** |Choose the Azure location that the SQL Servers are in. |

* Click **Create**. 

Azure creates the load balancer that you configured above. The load balancer belongs to a specific network, subnet, resource group, and location. After Azure completes, verify the load balancer settings in Azure. 

Now, configure the load balancer IP address.  

* On the load balancer **Settings** blade, click **IP address**. The **IP address** blade shows that this is a private load balancer on the same virtual network as your SQL Servers. 
* Set the following settings: 

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Subnet** |Choose the subnet that the SQL Servers are in. |
| **Assignment** |**Static** |
| **IP address** |Type an unused virtual IP address from the subnet. |

* Save the settings.

Now the load balancer has an IP address. Record this IP address. You will use this IP address when you create a listener on the cluster. In a PowerShell script later in this article, use this address for the `$ILBIP` variable.

## 2. Configure the backend pool
The next step is to create a backend address pool. Azure calls the backend address pool *backend pool*. In this case, the backend pool is the addresses of the two SQL Servers in your availability group. 

* In your resource group, click on the load balancer you created. 
* On **Settings**, click **Backend pools**.
* On **Backend address pools**, click **Add** to create a backend address pool. 
* On **Add backend pool** under **Name**, type a name for the backend pool.
* Under **Virtual machines** click **+ Add a virtual machine**. 
* Under **Choose virtual machines** click **Choose an availability set** and specify the availablity set that the SQL Server virtual machines belong to.
* After you have chosen the availability set, click **Choose the virtual machines**. Click the two virtual machines that host the SQL Server instances in the availability group. Click **Select**. 
* Click **OK** to close the blades for **Choose virtual machines**, and **Add backend pool**. 

Azure updates the settings for the backend address pool. Now your availability set has a pool of two SQL Servers.

## 3. Create a probe
The next step is to create a probe. The probe defines how Azure will verify which of the SQL Servers currently owns the availability group listener. Azure will probe the service based on IP address on a port that you define when you create the probe.

* On the load balancer **Settings** blade, click **Probes**. 
* On the **Probes** blade, click **Add**.
* Configure the probe on the **Add probe** blade. Use the following values to configure the probe:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Name** |A text name representing the probe. For example, **SQLAlwaysOnEndPointProbe**. |
| **Protocol** |**TCP** |
| **Port** |You may use any available port. For example, *59999*. |
| **Interval** |*5* |
| **Unhealthy threshold** |*2* |

* Click **OK**. 

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure that the port you specify is open on the firewall of both SQL Servers. Both servers require an inbound rule for the TCP port that you use. See [Add or Edit Firewall Rule](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc753558.aspx) for more information. 
> 
> 

Azure creates the probe. Azure will use the probe to test which SQL Server has the listener for the availability group.

## 4. Set the load balancing rules
Set the load balancing rules. The load balancing rules configure how the load balancer routes traffic to the SQL Servers. For this load balancer you will enable direct server return because only one of the two SQL Servers will ever own the availability group listener resource at a time.

* On the load balancer **Settings** blade, click **Load balancing rules**. 
* On the **Load balancing rules** blade, click **Add**.
* Use the **Add load balancing rules** blade to configure the load balancing rule. Use the following settings: 

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Name** |A text name representing the load balancing rules. For example, **SQLAlwaysOnEndPointListener**. |
| **Protocol** |**TCP** |
| **Port** |*1433* |
| **Backend Port** |*1433*. Note that this will be disabled because this rule uses **Floating IP (direct server return)**. |
| **Probe** |Use the name of the probe that you created for this load balancer. |
| **Session persistance** |**None** |
| **Idle timeout (minutes)** |*4* |
| **Floating IP (direct server return)** |**Enabled** |

> [!NOTE]
> You might have to scroll down on the blade to see all of the settings.
> 
> 

* Click **OK**. 
* Azure configures the load balancing rule. Now the load balancer is configured to route traffic to the SQL Server that hosts the listener for the availability group. 

At this point the resource group has a load balancer, connecting to both SQL Server machines. The load balancer also contains an IP address for the SQL Server AlwaysOn availablity group listener so that either machine can respond to requests for the availability groups.

> [!NOTE]
> If your SQL Servers are in two separate regions, repeat the steps in the other region. Each region requires a load balancer. 
>

## Configure the cluster to use the load balancer IP address
The next step is to configure the listener on the cluster, and bring the listener online. To accomplish this, do the following: 

1. Create the availablity group listener on the failover cluster 
2. Bring the listener online

## 1. Create the availablity group listener on the failover cluster
In this step, you manually create the availability group listener in Failover Cluster Manager and SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).

* Use RDP to connect to the Azure virtual machine that hosts the primary replica. 
* Open Failover Cluster Manager.
* Select the **Networks** node, and note the cluster network name. This name will be used in the `$ClusterNetworkName` variable in the PowerShell script.
* Expand the cluster name, and then click **Roles**.
* In the **Roles** pane, right-click the availability group name and then select **Add Resource** > **Client Access Point**.
* In the **Name** box, create a name for this new listener, then click **Next** twice, and then click **Finish**. Do not bring the listener or resource online at this point.
  
  > [!NOTE]
  > The name for the new listener is the network name that applications will use to connect to databases in the SQL Server availability group.
  > 
* Click the **Resources** tab, then expand the Client Access Point you just created. Right-click the IP resource and click properties. Note the name of the IP address. You will use this name in the `$IPResourceName` variable in the PowerShell script.
* Under **IP Address** click **Static IP Address** and set the static IP address to the same address that you used when you set the load balancer IP address on the Azure portal. Enable NetBIOS for this address and click **OK**. Repeat this step for each IP resource if your solution spans multiple Azure VNets. 
* On the cluster node that currently hosts the primary replica, open an elevated PowerShell ISE and paste the following commands into a new script.
  
        $ClusterNetworkName = "<MyClusterNetworkName>" # the cluster network name (Use Get-ClusterNetwork on Windows Server 2012 of higher to find the name)
        $IPResourceName = "<IPResourceName>" # the IP Address resource name
        $ILBIP = “<X.X.X.X>” # the IP Address of the Internal Load Balancer (ILB). This is the static IP address for the load balancer you configured in the Azure portal.
  
        Import-Module FailoverClusters
  
        Get-ClusterResource $IPResourceName | Set-ClusterParameter -Multiple @{"Address"="$ILBIP";"ProbePort"="59999";"SubnetMask"="255.255.255.255";"Network"="$ClusterNetworkName";"EnableDhcp"=0}
* Update the variables and run the PowerShell script to configure the IP address and port for the new listener.
  
  > [!NOTE]
  > If your SQL Servers are in separate regions, you need to run the PowerShell script twice. The first time use the cluster network name, cluster IP resource name, and load balancer IP address from the first resource group. The second time use the cluster network name, cluster IP resource name, and load balancer IP address from the second resource group.
  > 
  > 

Now the cluster has an availability group listener resource.

## 2. Bring the listener online
With the availability group listener resource configured, you can bring the listener online so that applications can connect to databases in the availability group with the listener.

* Navigate back to Failover Cluster Manager. Expand **Roles** and then highlight your Availability Group. On the **Resources** tab, right-click the listener name and click **Properties**.
* Click the **Dependencies** tab. If there are multiple resources listed, verify that the IP addresses have OR, not AND, dependencies. Click **OK**.
* Right-click the listener name and click **Bring Online**.
* Once the listener is online, from the **Resources** tab, right-click the availability group and click **Properties**.
* Create a dependency on the listener name resource (not the IP address resources name). Click **OK**.
* Launch SQL Server Management Studio and connect to the primary replica.
* Navigate to **AlwaysOn High Availability** | **Availability Groups** | **Availability Group Listeners**. 
* You should now see the listener name that you created in Failover Cluster Manager. Right-click the listener name and click **Properties**.
* In the **Port** box, specify the port number for the availability group listener by using the $EndpointPort you used earlier (1433 was the default), then click **OK**.

You now have a SQL Server AlwaysOn availability group in Azure virtual machines running in resource manager mode. 

## Test the connection to the listener
To test the connection:

1. RDP to a SQL Server that is in the same virtual network, but does not own the replica. This can be the other SQL Server in the cluster.
2. Use **sqlcmd** utility to test the connection. For example, the following script establishes a **sqlcmd** connection to the primary replica through the listener with Windows authentication:
   
        sqlcmd -S <listenerName> -E

The SQLCMD connection automatically connect to whichever instance of SQL Server hosts the primary replica. 

## Guidelines and limitations
Note the following guidelines on availablity group listener in Azure using internal load balancer:

* Only one internal availablity group listener is supported per cloud service because the listener is configured to the load balancer, and there is only one internal load balancer. However it is possible to create multipe external listeners. 
* With an internal load balancer you only access the listener from within the same virtual network.
