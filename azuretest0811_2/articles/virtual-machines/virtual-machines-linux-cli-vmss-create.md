# What are virtual machine scale sets?
Virtual Machine Scale Sets allow you to manage multiple VMs as a set. At a high level, scale sets have the following pros and cons:

Pros:

1. High availability. Each scale set puts its VMs into an Availability Set with 5 Fault Domains (FDs) and 5 Update Domains (UDs) to ensure availability (for more information on FDs and UDs, see [VM availability](virtual-machines-linux-manage-availability.md)). 
2. Easy integration with Azure Load Balancer and App Gateway.
3. Easy integration with Azure Autoscale.
4. Simplified deployment, management, and clean up of VMs.
5. Support common Windows and Linux flavors, as well as custom images.

Cons:

1. Cannot attach data disks to VM instances in a scale set. Instead, must use Blob Storage, Azure Files, Azure Tables, or other storage solution.
