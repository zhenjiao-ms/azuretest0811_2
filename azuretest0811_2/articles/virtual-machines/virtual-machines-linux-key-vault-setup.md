# Set up Key Vault for virtual machines in Azure Resource Manager
[!INCLUDE [learn-about-deployment-models](../../includes/learn-about-deployment-models-rm-include.md)] classic deployment model

In Azure Resource Manager stack, secrets/certificates are modeled as resources that are provided by the resource provider of Key Vault. To learn more about Azure Key Vault, see [What is Azure Key Vault?](../key-vault/key-vault-whatis.md)

In order for Key Vault to be used with Azure Resource Manager virtual machines, the *EnabledForDeployment* property on Key Vault must be set to true. You can do this in various clients.”

## Use CLI to set up Key Vault
To create a key vault by using the command-line interface (CLI), see [Manage Key Vault using CLI](../key-vault/key-vault-manage-with-cli.md#create-a-key-vault).

For CLI, you have to create the key vault before you assign the deployment policy. You can do this by using the following command:

    azure keyvault set-policy ContosoKeyVault –enabled-for-deployment true

## Use templates to set up Key Vault
When you use a template, you need to set the `enabledForDeployment` property to `true` for the Key Vault resource.

    {
      "type": "Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults",
      "name": "ContosoKeyVault",
      "apiVersion": "2015-06-01",
      "location": "<location-of-key-vault>",
      "properties": {
        "enabledForDeployment": "true",
        ....
        ....
      }
    }

For other options that you can configure when you create a key vault by using templates, see [Create a key vault](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/templates/101-key-vault-create/).
