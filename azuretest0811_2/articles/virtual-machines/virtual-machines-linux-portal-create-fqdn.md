# Create a Fully Qualified Domain Name in the Azure portal
When you create a virtual machine (VM) in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using the Resource Manager deployment model, a public IP resource for the virtual machine is automatically created. You can use this IP address to remotely access the VM. Although the portal does not create a [fully qualified domain name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name), or FQDN, by default, it is extremely easy to create one once the VM is created. This article demonstrates the steps to create a DNS name or FQDN.

[!INCLUDE [virtual-machines-common-portal-create-fqdn](../../includes/virtual-machines-common-portal-create-fqdn.md)]

You can now connect remotely to the VM using this DNS name such as with `ssh adminuser@testdnslabel.centralus.cloudapp.azure.com`.

## Next steps
Now that your VM has a public IP and DNS name, you can deploy common application frameworks or services such as nginx, MongoDB, Docker, etc.

You can also read more about [using Resource Manager](../resource-group-overview.md) for tips on building your Azure deployments.
