# Export an Azure Resource Manager template from existing resources
Resource Manager enables you to export a Resource Manager template from existing resources in your subscription. You can use that generated template to learn about the template syntax or to automate the redeployment of your solution as needed.

It is important to note that there are two different ways to export a template:

* You can export the actual template that you used for a deployment. The exported template includes all the parameters and variables exactly as they appeared in the original template. This approach is helpful when you have deployed resources through the portal. Now, you want to see how to construct the template to create those resources.
* You can export a template that represents the current state of the resource group. The exported template is not based on any template that you used for deployment. Instead, it creates a template that is a snapshot of the resource group. The exported template has many hard-coded values and probably not as many parameters as you would typically define. This approach is useful when you have modified the resource group through the portal or scripts. Now, you need to capture the resource group as a template.

This topic shows both approaches. In the [Customize an exported Azure Resource Manager template](resource-manager-customize-template.md) article, you see how to take a template you generated from the current state of the resource group and make it more useful for redeploying your solution.

In this tutorial, you sign in to the Azure portal, create a storage account, and export the template for that storage account. You add a virtual network to modify the resource group. Finally, you export a new template that represents its current state. Although this article focuses on a simplified infrastructure, you could use these same steps to export a template for a more complicated solution.

## Create a storage account
1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **New** > **Data + Storage** > **Storage account**.
   
      ![create storage](./media/resource-manager-export-template/create-storage.png)
2. Create a storage account with the name **storage**, your initials, and the date. The storage account name must be unique across Azure. If you initially try a name that's already in use, try a variation. For resource group, use **ExportGroup**. You can use the default values for the other properties. Select **Create**.
   
      ![provide values for storage](./media/resource-manager-export-template/provide-storage-values.png)

After the deployment finishes, your subscription contains the storage account.

## Export the template from deployment history
1. Go to the resource group blade for your new resource group. Notice that the blade shows the result of the last deployment. Select this link.
   
      ![resource group blade](./media/resource-manager-export-template/resource-group-blade.png)
2. You see a history of deployments for the group. In your case, the blade probably lists only one deployment. Select this deployment.
   
     ![last deployment](./media/resource-manager-export-template/last-deployment.png)
3. The blade displays a summary of the deployment. The summary includes the status of the deployment and its operations and the values that you provided for parameters. To see the template that you used for the deployment, select **View template**.
   
     ![view deployment summary](./media/resource-manager-export-template/deployment-summary.png)
4. Resource Manager retrieves the following six files for you:
   
   1. **Template** - The template that defines the infrastructure for your solution. When you created the storage account through the portal, Resource Manager used a template to deploy it and saved that template for future reference.
   2. **Parameters** - A parameter file that you can use to pass in values during deployment. It contains the values that you provided during the first deployment, but you can change any of these values when you redeploy the template.
   3. **CLI** - An Azure command-line-interface (CLI) script file that you can use to deploy the template.
   4. **PowerShell** - An Azure PowerShell script file that you can use to deploy the template.
   5. **.NET** - A .NET class that you can use to deploy the template.
   6. **Ruby** - A Ruby class that you can use to deploy the template.
      
      The files are available through links across the blade. By default, the blade displays the template.
      
       ![view template](./media/resource-manager-export-template/view-template.png)
      
      Let's pay particular attention to the template. Your template should look similar to:
      
        {
      
          "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2015-01-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
          "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
          "parameters": {
            "name": {
              "type": "String"
            },
            "accountType": {
              "type": "String"
            },
            "location": {
              "type": "String"
            },
            "encryptionEnabled": {
              "defaultValue": false,
              "type": "Bool"
            }
          },
          "resources": [
            {
              "type": "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts",
              "sku": {
                "name": "[parameters('accountType')]"
              },
              "kind": "Storage",
              "name": "[parameters('name')]",
              "apiVersion": "2016-01-01",
              "location": "[parameters('location')]",
              "properties": {
                "encryption": {
                  "services": {
                    "blob": {
                      "enabled": "[parameters('encryptionEnabled')]"
                    }
                  },
                  "keySource": "Microsoft.Storage"
                }
              }
            }
          ]
        }

This template is the actual template used to create your storage account. Notice it contains parameters that enable you to deploy different types of storage accounts. To learn more about the structure of a template, see [Authoring Azure Resource Manager templates](resource-group-authoring-templates.md). For the complete list of the functions you can use in a template, see [Azure Resource Manager template functions](resource-group-template-functions.md).

## Add a virtual network
The template that you downloaded in the previous section represented the infrastructure for that original deployment. However, it will not account for any changes you make after the deployment.
To illustrate this issue, let's modify the resource group by adding a virtual network through the portal.

1. In the resource group blade, select **Add**.
   
      ![add resource](./media/resource-manager-export-template/add-resource.png)
2. Select **Virtual network** from the available resources.
   
      ![select virtual network](./media/resource-manager-export-template/select-vnet.png)
3. Name your virtual network **VNET**, and use the default values for the other properties. Select **Create**.
   
      ![set alert](./media/resource-manager-export-template/create-vnet.png)
4. After the virtual network has successfully deployed to your resource group, look again at the deployment history. You now see two deployments. If you do not see the second deployment, you may need to close your resource group blade and reopen it. Select the more recent deployment.
   
      ![deployment history](./media/resource-manager-export-template/deployment-history.png)
5. Look at the template for that deployment. Notice that it defines only the changes that you have made to add the virtual network.

It is generally a best practice to work with a template that deploys all the infrastructure for your solution in a single operation. This approach is more reliable than remembering many different templates to deploy.

## Export the template from resource group
Although each deployment shows only the changes that you have made to your resource group, at any time you can export a template to show the attributes of your entire resource group.  

1. To view the template for a resource group, select **Automation script**.
   
      ![export resource group](./media/resource-manager-export-template/export-resource-group.png)
   
     Not all resource types support the export template function. If your resource group only contains the storage account and virtual network shown in this article, you will not see an error. However, if you have created other resource types, you may see an error stating that there is a problem with the export. You learn how to handle those issues in the [Fix export issues](#fix-export-issues) section.
2. You again see the six files that you can use to redeploy the solution, but this time the template is a little different. This template has only two parameters: one for the storage account name, and one for the virtual network name.
   
        "parameters": {
          "virtualNetworks_VNET_name": {
            "defaultValue": "VNET",
            "type": "String"
          },
          "storageAccounts_storagetf05092016_name": {
            "defaultValue": "storagetf05092016",
            "type": "String"
          }
        },
   
     Resource Manager did not retrieve the templates that you used during deployment. Instead, it generated a new template that's based on the current configuration of the resources. For example, the template sets the storage account location and replication value to:
   
        "location": "northeurope",
        "tags": {},
        "properties": {
            "accountType": "Standard_RAGRS"
        },
3. Download the template so that you can work on it locally.
   
      ![download template](./media/resource-manager-export-template/download-template.png)
4. Find the .zip file that you downloaded and extract the contents. You can use this downloaded template to redeploy your infrastructure.

## Fix export issues
Not all resource types support the export template function. Resource Manager specifically does not export some resource types to prevent exposing sensitive data. For example, if you have a connection string in your site config, you probably do not want it explicitly displayed in an exported template. You can get around this issue by manually adding the missing resources back into your template.

> [!NOTE]
> You only encounter export issues when exporting from a resource group rather than from your deployment history. If your last deployment accurately represents the current state of the resource group, you should export the template from the deployment history rather than from the resource group. Only export from a resource group when you have made changes to the resource group that are not defined in a single template.
> 
> 

For example, if you export a template for a resource group that contains a web app, SQL Database, and a connection string in the site config, you will see the following message.

![show error](./media/resource-manager-export-template/show-error.png)

Selecting the message shows you exactly which resource types were not exported. 

![show error](./media/resource-manager-export-template/show-error-details.png)

This topic shows the following common fixes. To implement these resources, you need to add parameters to template. For more information, see [Customize and redeploy exported template](resource-manager-customize-template.md).

### Connection string
In the web sites resource, add a definition for the connection string to the database:

```
{
  "type": "Microsoft.Web/sites",
  ...
  "resources": [
    {
      "apiVersion": "2015-08-01",
      "type": "config",
      "name": "connectionstrings",
      "dependsOn": [
          "[concat('Microsoft.Web/Sites/', parameters('<site-name>'))]"
      ],
      "properties": {
          "DefaultConnection": {
            "value": "[concat('Data Source=tcp:', reference(concat('Microsoft.Sql/servers/', parameters('<database-server-name>'))).fullyQualifiedDomainName, ',1433;Initial Catalog=', parameters('<database-name>'), ';User Id=', parameters('<admin-login>'), '@', parameters('<database-server-name>'), ';Password=', parameters('<admin-password>'), ';')]",
              "type": "SQLServer"
          }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```    

### Web site extension
In the web site resource, add a definition for the code to install:

```
{
  "type": "Microsoft.Web/sites",
  ...
  "resources": [
    {
      "name": "MSDeploy",
      "type": "extensions",
      "location": "[resourceGroup().location]",
      "apiVersion": "2015-08-01",
      "dependsOn": [
        "[concat('Microsoft.Web/sites/', parameters('<site-name>'))]"
      ],
      "properties": {
        "packageUri": "[concat(parameters('<artifacts-location>'), '/', parameters('<package-folder>'), '/', parameters('<package-file-name>'), parameters('<sas-token>'))]",
        "dbType": "None",
        "connectionString": "",
        "setParameters": {
          "IIS Web Application Name": "[parameters('<site-name>')]"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Virtual machine extension
For examples of virtual machine extensions, see [Azure Windows VM Extension Configuration Samples](virtual-machines/virtual-machines-windows-extensions-configuration-samples.md).

### Virtual network gateway
Add a virtual network gateway resource type.

```
{
  "type": "Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworkGateways",
  "name": "[parameters('<gateway-name>')]",
  "apiVersion": "2015-06-15",
  "location": "[resourceGroup().location]",
  "properties": {
    "gatewayType": "[parameters('<gateway-type>')]",
    "ipConfigurations": [
      {
        "name": "default",
        "properties": {
          "privateIPAllocationMethod": "Dynamic",
          "subnet": {
            "id": "[resourceId('Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets', parameters('<vnet-name>'), parameters('<new-subnet-name>'))]"
          },
          "publicIpAddress": {
            "id": "[resourceId('Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses', parameters('<new-public-ip-address-Name>'))]"
          }
        }
      }
    ],
    "enableBgp": false,
    "vpnType": "[parameters('<vpn-type>')]"
  },
  "dependsOn": [
    "Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/codegroup4/subnets/GatewaySubnet",
    "[concat('Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses/', parameters('<new-public-ip-address-Name>'))]"
  ]
},
```

### Local network gateway
Add a local network gateway resource type.

```
{
    "type": "Microsoft.Network/localNetworkGateways",
    "name": "[parameters('<local-network-gateway-name>')]",
    "apiVersion": "2015-06-15",
    "location": "[resourceGroup().location]",
    "properties": {
      "localNetworkAddressSpace": {
        "addressPrefixes": "[parameters('<address-prefixes>')]"
      }
    }
}
```

### Connection
Add a connection resource type.

```
{
    "apiVersion": "2015-06-15",
    "name": "[parameters('<connection-name>')]",
    "type": "Microsoft.Network/connections",
    "location": "[resourceGroup().location]",
    "properties": {
        "virtualNetworkGateway1": {
        "id": "[resourceId('Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworkGateways', parameters('<gateway-name>'))]"
      },
      "localNetworkGateway2": {
        "id": "[resourceId('Microsoft.Network/localNetworkGateways', parameters('<local-gateway-name>'))]"
      },
      "connectionType": "IPsec",
      "routingWeight": 10,
      "sharedKey": "[parameters('<shared-key>')]"
    }
},
```
