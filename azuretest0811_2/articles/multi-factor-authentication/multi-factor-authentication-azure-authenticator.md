# Moving to the new Azure Authenticator app
With the release of the Azure Authenticator app, available for [Windows Phone](http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/azure-authenticator/03a5b2bf-6066-418f-b569-e8aecbc06e50), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.azure.authenticator), and [IOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/azure-authenticator/id983156458), the old Multi-Factor Authentication app is being replaced.  The Multi-Factor Authentication app will continue to work but should you decide to move to the new Azure Authenticator app then this article can assist you.

**Step 2:** Activate your accounts with the new app

First of all make sure, you have the QR code or code and URL for manual entry handy for the account you’d like to add to the app.

Once you have the QR code in front of you, launch the app. Click +.

This will launch the camera to scan the QR code.  If you are unable to scan the QR code, you always have the manual entry option. 

To confirm that the account is successfully activated, verify that the new account shows up on the accounts pages. 

Follow this step for all your accounts that you’d like to migrate to the new app.

**Step 3:**  Uninstall the old Multi-Factor Authentication app from your phone.

Once you have added all the accounts to the new app uninstall the old app from your phone.

## How to add an account using TouchID
The Azure Authenticator mobile app on iOS supports Touch ID.  Azure Multi-Factor Authentication allows organizations to require a PIN in addition to having possession of their registered device. With this new feature, iOS users with Touch ID-enabled devices won’t need to enter the PIN anymore. Once set up, users just scan their fingerprint instead of entering PIN and tapping Approve.

Setting up Touch ID with Azure Authenticator is really simple. You just complete a normal verification challenge with PIN, and if your device supports Touch ID, we’ll automatically set it up for you. 

![Touch ID](./media/multi-factor-authentication-azure-authenticator/touchid1.png)

From that point forward, when you are required to verify your sign-in, you tap on the push notification received and scan your fingerprint instead of entering your PIN.

## How to delete an account
To remove individual accounts from the Azure Authenticator App simply tap on the account. You’ll get an option to “Delete”.
