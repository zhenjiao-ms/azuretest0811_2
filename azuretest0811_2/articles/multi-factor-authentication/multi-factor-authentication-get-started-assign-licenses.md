# Assigning an Azure MFA, Azure AD Premium, or Enterprise Mobility license to users
If you have purchased Azure MFA, Azure AD Premium, or Enterprise Mobility Suite licenses, you do not need to create a Multi-Factor Auth provider. You need to simply assign the licenses to your users and then you can begin enabling them for MFA.

## To assign an Azure MFA, Azure AD Premium, or Enterprise Mobility Suite License
- - -
1. Sign in to the **Azure classic portal** as an Administrator.
2. On the left, select **Active Directory**.
3. On the Active Directory page, double-click on the directory that has the users you wish to enable.
4. At the top of the directory page, select **Licenses**.

5. On the Licenses page, select **Azure Multi-Factor Authentication**, **Active Directory Premium**, or **Enterprise Mobility Suite**.  If you only have one then it should be selected automatically. 
6. At the bottom of the page, click **Assign**.
