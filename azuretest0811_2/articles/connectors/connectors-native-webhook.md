# Get started with the webhook connector
With the webhook action and trigger you can trigger, pause, and resume flows to accomplish:

* Trigger from an [Azure Event Hub as soon as an item](https://github.com/logicappsio/EventHubAPI) is received
* Wait for an approval before continuing a workflow

Information on creating an API that supports a webhook subscribe can be found [in this article on creating Logic App connectors](../app-service-logic/app-service-logic-create-api-app.md).

## Use the webhook trigger
A trigger is an event that can be used to start the workflow defined in a Logic app. [Learn more about triggers](connectors-overview.md).  A webhook trigger is especially useful as it doesn't rely on polling for new items - like the [request trigger](connectors-native-reqres.md) the logic app will fire the instant an event occurs.  It does this by registering a *callback URL* to a service which can be used to fire the logic app as needed.

Hereâ€™s an example sequence of how to setup a HTTP trigger in the logic app designer.  This assumes you have already deployed or are accessing an API that follows [the webhook subscribe and unsubscribe pattern used in Logic Apps](../app-service-logic/app-service-logic-create-api-app.md#webhook-triggers).  The subscribe call is made whenever a logic app is saved with a new webhook, or switched from disabled to enabled.  The unsubscribe call is made whenever a logic app webhook trigger is removed and saved, or switched from enabled to disabled.

1. Add the **HTTP Webhook** trigger as the first step in a logic app
2. Fill in the parameters for the webhook subscribe and unsubscribe calls
   
   * This follow the same pattern as the [HTTP action](connectors-native-http.md) format
     
     ![HTTP Trigger](./media/connectors-native-webhook/using-trigger.png)
3. Add at least one action
4. Click save to publish the logic app - this will call the subscribe endpoint with the callback URL needed to trigger this logic app
5. Whenever the service makes an `HTTP POST` to the callback URL, the logic app will fire (and include any data passed in the request)

## Use the webhook action
An action is an operation carried out by the workflow defined in a logic app. [Learn more about actions.](connectors-overview.md)  A webhook action is especially useful as it will register a *callback URL* with a service and wait until the URL is called before resuming.  The ["Send Approval Email"](connectors-create-api-office365-outlook.md) is an example of a connector that follows this pattern.  You can extend this pattern into any service through the webhook action.  This assumes you have already deployed or are accessing an API that follows [the webhook subscribe and unsubscribe pattern used in Logic Apps](../app-service-logic/app-service-logic-create-api-app.md#webhook-actions).  The subscribe call is made whenever a logic app executes the webhook action.  The unsubscribe call is made whenever a run is cancelled while awaiting a response, or before the logic app run times out.

To add a webhook action:

1. Select the **New Step** button
2. Choose **Add an action**
3. In the action search box, type "webhook" to list the **HTTP Webhook** action
   
    ![Select query action](./media/connectors-native-webhook/using-action-1.png)
4. Fill in the parameters for the webhook subscribe and unsubscribe calls
   
   * This follow the same pattern as the [HTTP action](connectors-native-http.md) format
     
     ![Complete query action](./media/connectors-native-webhook/using-action-2.png)
   * At runtime the logic app will call the subscribe endpoint once it reaches the step
5. Click save at the top left corner of the toolbar, and your logic app will both save and publish (activate)
