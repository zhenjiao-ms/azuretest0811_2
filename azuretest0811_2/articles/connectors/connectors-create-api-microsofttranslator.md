# Get started with the Microsoft Translator connector
Connect to Microsoft Translator to translate text, detect a language, and more. The Microsoft Translator connector can be used from:

* Logic apps 
* PowerApps

> [!div class="op_single_selector"]
> * [Logic apps](connectors-create-api-microsofttranslator.md)
> * [PowerApps Enterprise](../power-apps/powerapps-create-api-microsofttranslator.md)
> 
> 

With Microsoft Translator, you can: 

* Build your business flow based on the data you get from Microsoft Translator. 
* Use actions to translate text, detect a language, and more. These actions get a response, and then make the output available for other actions. For example, when a new file is created in Dropbox, you can translate the text in the file to another language using Microsoft Translator.
* Add the Microsoft Translator connector to PowerApps Enterprise. Then, your users can use this connector within their apps. 

For information on how to add a connector in PowerApps Enterprise, go to [Register a connector in PowerApps](../power-apps/powerapps-register-from-available-apis.md). 

To add an operation in logic apps, see [Create a logic app](../app-service-logic/app-service-logic-create-a-logic-app.md).
