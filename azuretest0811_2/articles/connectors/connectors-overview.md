# Using connectors in a logic app
Connectors provide quick access to events, data, and actions across services, protocols, and platforms.  The full list of connectors that Logic Apps supports can [be found here](apis-list.md).  Connectors can be used as a trigger or an action in a logic app, and may require a configured *connection* to use (for example: authorizing a Twitter account to access or post on your behalf).

## Basics
Connectors are hosted services you can access as part of a logic app to integrate with other services like Dynamics, Azure, Salesforce, [and more](apis-list.md).  They are deployed and managed by Microsoft, so you can build your integration workflows with scale, throughput, and security taken care of.  You can add a connector to a logic app by searching and selecting a connector action or trigger under **Show Microsoft managed APIs**.

Each connector action or trigger will have its set of properties to configure.  You can click on the info buttons to learn more about action, or reference its documentation [to learn more](apis-list.md).

If you want to integrate with a service or API that isn't yet a connector, you can also extend logic apps through a [custom connector](../app-service-logic/app-service-logic-create-api-app.md) or just call directly to the service over a protocol like HTTP.

## Triggers
Some connectors have a trigger, which means an event from that connector will fire a logic app and pass in any data as part of the trigger.  A trigger is always the first step in a logic app.  Popular triggers include operations like:

* Recurrence - run every hour
* When an HTTP request is received
* When an item is added to a queue
* When an email is received

Some triggers will fire the instant an event happens through a notification to the logic app, and others will need a recurrence interval configured on how often the logic app will check the service for an event (up to every 15 seconds).  

Once an event is received, the logic app run will fire and the actions in the workflow will start.  You will also be able to access any data from the trigger throughout the workflow (for example the 'On a new tweet' trigger will pass the tweet into the run).

## Actions
Most connectors have one or many actions that can be executed as part of the workflow.  Actions are any steps that happen after the run has fired from a trigger.  To add an action click the **New Step** button and search for the connector you want to use.  Once selected (and after configuring any [connections](#connections) that may be required) you will see the action card you can configure.  You can select data from previous steps by clicking on any of the tokens for outputs, or enter in any other configuration as needed.

## Connections
Most connectors require you to configure a *connection* before you can use the connector.  A *connection* is any login or connection configuration needed to access the connector.  For connectors that use OAuth, create a connection means signing into the service (like Office 365, Salesforce, or GitHub) where your access token can be encrypted and securely stored in an Azure secret store.  Other connectors (like FTP and SQL) require a connection that contains configuration like server address, username, and password.  These connection configuration details are also encrypted and securely stored.  Connections will be able to access the service for as long as the service allows.  For Azure Active Directory OAuth connections (like Office 365 and Dynamics) we can continue to refresh the access token indefinitely.  Other services may put limits on how long we can use a token without it being refreshed.  In general certain actions like changing a password will invalidate all access tokens.  

Connections can be viewed and managed in Azure by clicking **Browse** and selecting **API Connections**.  From the API Connections resource you can view, edit, update, or re-authorize any connections you have created.
