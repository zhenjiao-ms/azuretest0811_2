# Get started with the recurrence trigger
With the recurrence trigger, you can create powerful workflows in the cloud like:

* Schedule a workflow to run a SQL stored procedure every day
* Email a summary of all tweets within the last week about a certain hashtag

To get started using the recurrence trigger in a logic app, see [create a logic app](../app-service-logic/app-service-logic-create-a-logic-app.md).

## Use a recurrence trigger
A trigger is an event that can be used to start the workflow defined in a Logic app. [Learn more about triggers](connectors-overview.md). 

Hereâ€™s an example sequence of how to setup a recurrence trigger in a logic app

1. Add the **Recurrence** trigger as the first step in a logic app
2. Fill in the parameters for the recurrence interval
3. The logic app will now start a run after each interval of time

## Technical details
Below are the details for the recurrence trigger and the parameters you can configure.

### Trigger Details
The recurrence trigger has the following properties that can be configured.

#### Recurrence
Fire a logic app after a specified time interval.
An * means required field.

| Display Name | Property Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Frequency* |frequency |The unit of time - `Second`, `Minute`, `Hour`, `Day`, or `Year` |
| Interval* |interval |Interval of the given frequency for the recurrence |
| Time Zone |timeZone |If a startTime is provided without a UTC offset, this timeZone will be used |
| Start time |startTime |Start time in [ISO 8601 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Combined_date_and_time_representations). If a startTime is provided without a UTC offset, this timeZone will be used |
