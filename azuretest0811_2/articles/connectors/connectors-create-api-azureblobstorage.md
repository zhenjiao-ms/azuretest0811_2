# Get started with the Azure blob storage connector
Azure Blob storage is a service for storing large amounts of unstructured data. Perform various actions such as upload, update, get, and delete blobs in Azure blob storage. 

With Azure blob storage, you:

* Build your workflow by uploading new projects, or getting files that have been  recently updated.
* Use actions to get file metadata, delete a file, copy files, and more. For example,  when a tool is updated in an Azure web site (a trigger), then update a file in blob storage (an action). 

This topic shows you how to use the blob storage connector in a logic app, and also lists the actions.

> [!NOTE]

To learn more about Logic Apps, see [What are logic apps](../app-service-logic/app-service-logic-what-are-logic-apps.md) and [create a logic app](../app-service-logic/app-service-logic-create-a-logic-app.md).

## Connect to Azure blob storage
Before your logic app can access any service, you first create a *connection* to the service. A connection provides connectivity between a logic app and another service. For example, to connect to a storage account, you first create a blob storage *connection*. To create a connection, enter the credentials you normally use to access the service you are connecting to. So with Azure storage, enter the credentials to your storage account to create the connection. 

#### Create the connection
> [!INCLUDE [Create a connection to Azure blob storage](../../includes/connectors-create-api-azureblobstorage.md)]
> 
> 

## Use a trigger
This connector does not have any triggers. Use other triggers to start the logic app, such as a Recurrence trigger, an HTTP Webhook trigger, triggers available with other connectors, and more. [Create a logic app](../app-service-logic/app-service-logic-create-a-logic-app.md) provides an example.

## Use an action
An action is an operation carried out by the workflow defined in a logic app.

1. Select the plus sign. You see several choices: **Add an action**, **Add a condition**, or one of the **More** options.

2. Choose **Add an action**.
3. In the text box, type “blob” to get a list of all the available actions.
   
    ![](./media/connectors-create-api-azureblobstorage/actions.png) 
4. In our example, choose **AzureBlob - Get file metadata using path**. If a connection already exists, then select the **...** (Show Picker) button to select a file.
   
    ![](./media/connectors-create-api-azureblobstorage/sample-file.png)
   
    If you are prompted for the connection information, then enter the details to create the connection. [Create the connection](connectors-create-api-azureblobstorage.md#create-the-connection) in this topic describes these properties. 
   
   > [!NOTE]
   > In this example, we get the metadata of a file. To see the metadata, add another action that creates a new file using another connector. For example, add a OneDrive action that creates a new "test" file based on the metadata. 
   > 
5. **Save** your changes (top left corner of the toolbar). Your logic app is saved and may be automatically enabled.

> [!TIP]
> [Storage Explorer](http://storageexplorer.com/) is a great tool to  manage multiple storage accounts.
