# Get started with the SharePoint Online Connector
The SharePoint Connector provides an way to work with Lists on SharePoint.

> [!NOTE]
> This version of the article applies to logic apps 2015-08-01-preview schema version.
> 
> 

With SharePoint, you can:

* Use it to build logic apps
* Use it to build PowerApps  

To add an operation in logic apps, see [Create a logic app](../app-service-logic/app-service-logic-create-a-logic-app.md).

## Let's talk about triggers and actions
The SharePoint Connector  can be used as an action; it has trigger(s). All connectors support data in JSON and XML formats. 

The SharePoint Connector  has the following action(s) and/or trigger(s) available:

### SharePoint actions
You can take these action(s):

| Action | Description |
| --- | --- |
| GetFileMetadata |Used for getting a file metadata on Document Library |
| UpdateFile |Used for updating a file on Document Library |
| DeleteFile |Used for deleting a file on Document Library |
| GetFileMetadataByPath |Used for getting a file metadata on Document Library |
| GetFileContentByPath |Used for getting a file on Document Library |
| GetFileContent |Used for getting a file on Document Library |
| CreateFile |Used for uploading a file on Document Library |
| CopyFile |Used for copying a file on Document Library |
| ExtractFolderV2 |Used for extracting a folder on Document Library |
| PostItem |Creates a new item in a SharePoint list |
| GetItem |Retrieves a single item from a SharePoint list |
| DeleteItem |Deletes an item from a SharePoint list |
| PatchItem |Updates an item in a SharePoint list |

### SharePoint triggers
You can listen for these event(s):

| Trigger | Description |
| --- | --- |
| OnNewFile |Triggers a flow when a new file is created in a SharePoint folder |
| OnUpdatedFile |Triggers a flow when a file is modified in a SharePoint folder |
| GetOnNewItems |When a new item is created in a SharePoint list |
| GetOnUpdatedItems |When an existing item is modified in a SharePoint list |

## Create a connection to SharePoint
To use the SharePoint Connector , you first create a **connection** then provide the details for these properties: 

| Property | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Token |Yes |Provide SharePoint Credentials |

In order to connect to **SharePoint Online**, you need to provide your identity (username and password, smart card credentials, etc.) to SharePoint Online. Once you've been authenticated, you can proceed to use the SharePoint Online Connector  in your logic app. 

While on the designer of your logic app, follow these steps to sign into SharePoint to create the connection **connection** for use in your logic app:

1. Enter SharePoint in the search box and wait for the search to return all entries with SharePoint in the name:   
   ![Configure SharePoint](../../includes/media/connectors-create-api-sharepointonline/connectionconfig1.png)  
2. Select **SharePoint Online - When a file is created**   
3. Select **Sign in to SharePoint Online**:   
   ![Configure SharePoint](../../includes/media/connectors-create-api-sharepointonline/connectionconfig2.png)    
4. Provide your SharePoint credentials to sign in to authenticate with SharePoint   
   ![Configure SharePoint](../../includes/media/connectors-create-api-sharepointonline/connectionconfig3.png)     
5. After the authentication completes you'll be redirected to your logic app to complete it by configuring SharePoint's **When a file is created** dialog.          
   ![Configure SharePoint](../../includes/media/connectors-create-api-sharepointonline/connectionconfig4.png)  
6. You can then add other triggers and actions that you need to complete your logic app.   
7. Save your work by selecting **Save** on the menu bar above.  

> [!TIP]
> You can use this connection in other logic apps or PowerApps or both.
