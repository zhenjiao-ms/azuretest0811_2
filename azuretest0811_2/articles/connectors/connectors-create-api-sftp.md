# Get started with the SFTP connector
Use the SFTP connector to access an SFTP account to send and receive files. You can perform various operations such as create, update, get or delete files.  

To use [any connector](apis-list.md), you first need to create a logic app. You can get started by [creating a logic app now](../app-service-logic/app-service-logic-create-a-logic-app.md).

## Connect to SFTP
Before your logic app can access any service, you first need to create a *connection* to the service. A [connection](connectors-overview.md) provides connectivity between a logic app and another service.  

### Create a connection to SFTP
> [!INCLUDE [Steps to create a connection to SFTP](../../includes/connectors-create-api-sftp.md)]
> 
> 

## Use an SFTP trigger
A trigger is an event that can be used to start the workflow defined in a logic app. [Learn more about triggers](../app-service-logic/app-service-logic-what-are-logic-apps.md#logic-app-concepts).  

In this example, I will show you how to use the **SFTP - When a file is added or modified** trigger to initiate a logic app workflow when a file is added to, or modified on, an SFTP server. In the example, you will also learn how to add a condition that checks the contents of the new or modified file and make a decision to extract the file if its contents indicate that it  should be extracted before using the contents. Finally, you will learn how to add an action to extract the contents of a file and place the extracted contents in a folder on the SFTP server. 

In an enterprise example, you could use this trigger to monitor an SFTP folder for new files that represent orders from customers.  You could then use an SFTP connector action such as **Get file content** to get the contents of the order for further processing and storage in your orders database.

## Use an SFTP action
An action is an operation carried out by the workflow defined in a logic app. [Learn more about actions](../app-service-logic/app-service-logic-what-are-logic-apps.md#logic-app-concepts).
