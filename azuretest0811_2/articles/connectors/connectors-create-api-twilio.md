# Get started with the Twilio connector
Connect to Twilio to send and receive global SMS, MMS, and IP messages.

> [!NOTE]
> This version of the article applies to logic apps 2015-08-01-preview schema version.
> 
> 

With Twilio, you can:

* Build your business flow based on the data you get from Twilio. 
* Use actions that get a message, list messages, and more. These actions get a response, and then make the output available for other actions. For example, when  you get a new Twilio message, you can take this message and use it a Service Bus workflow. 

To add an operation in logic apps, see [Create a logic app](../app-service-logic/app-service-logic-create-a-logic-app.md).

## Triggers and actions
The Twilio Connector includes the following actions. There are no triggers. 

| Triggers | Actions |
| --- | --- |
| None |<ul><li>Get Message</li><li>List Messages</li><li>Send Message</li></ul> |

All connectors support data in JSON and XML formats.

| Account ID |Yes |Enter your Twilio account ID |
| Access Token |Yes |Enter your Twilio access token |

> [!INCLUDE [Steps to create a connection to Twilio](../../includes/connectors-create-api-twilio.md)]
> 
> 

If you don't have one, see [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/ip-messaging/guides/identity) to create an access token.
