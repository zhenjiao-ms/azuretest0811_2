# Get started with the query action
With the query action you can work with batches and arrays to accomplish workflows to:

* Create a task for all high priority records from a database.
* Save all PDF attachments for emails into Azure Blob.

To get started using the query action in a logic app, see [create a logic app](../app-service-logic/app-service-logic-create-a-logic-app.md).

## Use the query action
An action is an operation carried out by the workflow defined in a logic app. [Learn more about actions.](connectors-overview.md)  The query action currently has one operation exposed in the designer - filter array.  This allows you to query an array and return a set of filtered results.  Here's how you can add it in a logic app:

1. Select the **New Step** button
2. Choose **Add an action**
3. In the action search box, type "Filter" to list the **Filter array** action
   
    ![Select query action](./media/connectors-native-query/using-action-1.png)
4. Select an array to filter (the screenshot below shows the array of results from a Twitter search)
5. Create a condition to evaluate on each item (the screenshot below filters tweets from users with more than 100 followers)
   
    ![Complete query action](./media/connectors-native-query/using-action-2.png)
6. The action will output a new array that contains only results that met the filter requirements
7. Click save at the top left corner of the toolbar, and your logic app will both save and publish (activate)
