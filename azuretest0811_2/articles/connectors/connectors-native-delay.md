# Get started with the delay and delay until actions
With the delay and delay until actions, you can complete workflow scenarios like

* Wait until a weekday to send a status update over email
* Delay the workflow until an HTTP call has time to complete before resuming and retrieving the result

To get started using the delay action in a logic app, see [create a logic app](../app-service-logic/app-service-logic-create-a-logic-app.md).

## Use the delay actions
An action is an operation carried out by the workflow defined in a logic app. [Learn more about actions](connectors-overview.md). 

Hereâ€™s an example sequence of how to use a delay step in a logic app:

1. After adding a trigger, click the **New Step** to add an action
2. Search for "delay" to bring up the delay actions.  In this example we will select **Delay**
   
    ![Delay actions](./media/connectors-native-delay/using-action-1.png)
3. Complete any of the action properties to configure delay
   
    ![Delay config](./media/connectors-native-delay/using-action-2.png)
4. Click "Save" to publish and activate the logic app
