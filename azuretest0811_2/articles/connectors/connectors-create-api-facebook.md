# Get started with the Facebook connector
Connect to Facebook and post to a timeline, get a page feed, and more. The Facebook connector can be used from:

* Logic apps (discussed in this topic)
* PowerApps (see the [PowerApps connections list](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/tutorials/connections-list/) for the complete list)

> [!NOTE]
> This version of the article applies to logic apps 2015-08-01-preview schema version.
> 
> 

With Facebook, you can:

* Build your business flow based on the data you get from Facebook. 
* Use a trigger when a new post is received.
* Use actions that post to your timeline, get a page feed, and more. These actions get a response, and then make the output available for other actions. For example, when there is a new post on your timeline, you can take that post and push it to your Twitter feed. 

To add an operation in logic apps, see [Create a logic app](../app-service-logic/app-service-logic-create-a-logic-app.md).

## Triggers and actions
The Facebook connector includes the following trigger and actions. 

| Triggers | Actions |
| --- | --- |
| <ul><li>When there is a new post on my timeline</li></ul> |<ul><li>Get feed from my timeline</li><li>Post to my timeline</li><li>When there is a new post on my timeline</li><li>Get page feed</li><li>Get user timeline</li><li>Post to page</li></ul> |

All connectors support data in JSON and XML formats.

## Create a connection to Facebook
When you add this connector to your logic apps, you must authorize logic apps to connect to your Facebook.

1. Sign in to your Facebook account
2. Select **Authorize**, and allow your logic apps to connect and use your Facebook. 

> [!INCLUDE [Steps to create a connection to Facebook](../../includes/connectors-create-api-facebook.md)]
> 
> [!TIP]
> You can use this same Facebook connection in other logic apps.
