> [!NOTE]
> When you select **Update Schema**, we automatically run the migration steps and provide the code output for you. You can use this to update your definition, however, ensure you follow good coding practices such as those outlined in the **Best practices** section below.

## Best practices when migrating your Logic apps to the latest schema version:
* Copy the migrated script to a new Logic App - don't overwrite the old one until you've completed your testing and confirmed the migrated app works as expected.
* Test your Logic app **before** putting in production
* After migration completes, start updating your Logic apps to use the [managed APIs](apis-list.md) where possible. For example, you can start using Dropbox v2, whereever you are using DropBox v1.
