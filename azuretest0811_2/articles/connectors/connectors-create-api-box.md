# Get started with the Box connector
Connect to Box and create files, delete files, and more. The Box connector can be used from:

* Logic apps (discussed in this topic)
* PowerApps (see the [PowerApps connections list](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/tutorials/connections-list/) for the complete list)

> [!NOTE]
> This version of the article applies to logic apps 2015-08-01-preview schema version.
> 
> 

With Box, you can:

* Build your business flow based on the data you get from Box. 
* Use triggers when a file is created or updated.
* Use actions that copy a file, delete a file, and more. These actions get a response, and then make the output available for other actions. For example, when a file is changed on Box, you can take that file and email it using Office 365.

To add an operation in logic apps, see [Create a logic app](../app-service-logic/app-service-logic-create-a-logic-app.md).

## Triggers and actions
Box includes the following trigger and actions.

| Triggers | Actions |
| --- | --- |
| <ul><li>When a file is created</li><li>When a file is modified</li></ul> |<ul><li>Create file</li><li>When a file is created</li><li>Copy file</li><li>Delete file</li><li>Extract archive to folder</li><li>Get file content using id</li><li>Get file content using path</li><li>Get file metadata using id</li><li>Get file metadata using path</li><li>Update file</li><li>When a file is modified</li></ul> |

All connectors support data in JSON and XML formats.

## Create a connection to Box
When you add this connector to your logic apps, you must authorize logic apps to connect to your Box.

> [!INCLUDE [Steps to create a connection to box](../../includes/connectors-create-api-box.md)]
> 
> 

After you create the connection, you enter the Box properties. The **REST API reference** in this topic describes these properties.

> [!TIP]
> You can use this same Box connection in other logic apps.
> 
>
