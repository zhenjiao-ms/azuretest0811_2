# Get started with the CRM connector
Connect to Dynamics CRM Online to create a new record, update an item, and more. The CRM Online connector can be used from:

* Logic apps
* PowerApps

> [!div class="op_single_selector"]
> * [Logic apps](connectors-create-api-crmonline.md)
> * [PowerApps Enterprise](../power-apps/powerapps-create-api-crmonline.md)
> 
> 

With CRM Online, you can:

* Build your business flow based on the data you get from CRM Online. 
* Use actions that delete a record, get entities, and more. These actions get a response, and then make the output available for other actions. For example, when an item is updated in CRM, you can send an email using Office 365.

For information on how to add a connector in PowerApps Enterprise, go to [Register a connector in PowerApps](../power-apps/powerapps-register-from-available-apis.md).

To add an operation in logic apps, see [Create a logic app](../app-service-logic/app-service-logic-create-a-logic-app.md).

## Triggers and actions
The CRM connector includes the following actions. There are no triggers. 

| Triggers | Actions |
| --- | --- |
| None |<ul><li>Create a new record</li><li>Gets records</li><li>Delete a record</li><li>Gets a record</li><li>Gets entities</li><li>Update an item</li></ul> |

All connectors support data in JSON and XML formats.

## Create a connection to CRM Online
When you add this connector to your logic apps, you must sign in to Dynamics CRM Online. Follow these steps to sign into CRM online and complete the configuration of the **connection** in your logic app:

1. In your logic app, select **Add an action**:  
   ![Configure CRM Online](./media/connectors-create-api-crmonline/crmconfig1.png)
2. Enter CRM in the search box and wait for the search to return all entries with CRM in the name.
3. Select **Dynamics CRM Online - Create a new record**.
4. Select **Sign in to Dynamics CRM Online**:  
   ![Configure CRM Online](./media/connectors-create-api-crmonline/crmconfig2.png)
5. Provide your CRM Online credentials to sign in to authorize the application:  
   ![Configure CRM Online](./media/connectors-create-api-crmonline/crmconfig3.png)  
6. After signing in, return to your logic app to complete it by adding other triggers and actions that you need.
7. Save your work by selecting **Save** on the menu bar above.

After you create the connection, you enter the CRM Online properties, like the table or dataset. The **REST API reference** in this topic describes these properties.

> [!TIP]
> You can use this connection in other logic apps.
