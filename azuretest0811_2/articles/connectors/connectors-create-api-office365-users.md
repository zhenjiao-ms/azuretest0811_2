# Get started with the Office 365 Users connector
Connect to Office 365 Users to get profiles, search users, and more. The Office 365 Users connector can be used from:

* Logic apps 
* PowerApps

> [!div class="op_single_selector"]
> * [Logic apps](connectors-create-api-office365-users.md)
> * [PowerApps Enterprise](../power-apps/powerapps-create-api-office365-users.md)
> 
> 

&nbsp; 

> [!NOTE]
> This version of the article applies to logic apps 2015-08-01-preview schema version.
> 
> 

With Office 365 Users, you can:

* Build your business flow based on the data you get from Office 365 Users. 
* Use actions that get direct reports, get a manager's user profile, and more. These actions get a response, and then make the output available for other actions. For example, get a person's direct reports, and then take this information and update a SQL Azure database. 
* Add the Office 365 Users connector to PowerApps Enterprise. Then, your users can use this connector within their apps. 

For information on how to add a connector in PowerApps Enterprise, go to [Register a connector in PowerApps](../power-apps/powerapps-register-from-available-apis.md). 

To add an operation in logic apps, see [Create a logic app](../app-service-logic/app-service-logic-create-a-logic-app.md).

## Triggers and actions
The Office 365 Users connector has the following actions available. There are no triggers.

| Triggers | Actions |
| --- | --- |
| None |<ul><li>Get manager</li><li>Get my profile</li><li>Get direct reports</li><li>Get user profile</li><li>Search for users</li></ul> |

All connectors support data in JSON and XML formats. 

## Create a connection to Office 365 Users
When you add this connector to your logic apps, you must sign-in to your Office 365 Users account and allow logic apps to connect to your account.

> [!INCLUDE [Steps to create a connection to Office 365 Users](../../includes/connectors-create-api-office365users.md)]
> 
> 

After you create the connection, you enter the Office 365 Users properties, like the user ID. The **REST API reference** in this topic describes these properties.

> [!TIP]
> You can use this same Office 365 Users connection in other logic apps.
>
