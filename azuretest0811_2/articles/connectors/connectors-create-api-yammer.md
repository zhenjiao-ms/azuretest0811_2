# Get started with the Yammer connector
Connect to Yammer to access conversations in your enterprise network.

> [!NOTE]
> This version of the article applies to logic apps 2015-08-01-preview schema version.

With Yammer, you can:

* Build your business flow based on the data you get from Yammer. 
* Use triggers for when there is a new message in a group, or a feed your following.
* Use actions to post a message, get all messages, and more. These actions get a response, and then make the output available for other actions. For example, when a new message appears, you can send an email using Office 365.

To add an operation in logic apps, see [Create a logic app](../app-service-logic/app-service-logic-create-a-logic-app.md).

## Triggers and actions

## Yammer REST API reference
This documentation is for version: 1.0

### Get all public messages in the logged in user's Yammer network
Corresponds to "All" conversations in the Yammer web interface.  
```GET: /messages.json```

| Name | Data Type | Required | Located In | Default Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| older_then |integer |no |query |none |Returns messages older than the message ID specified as a numeric string. This is useful for paginating messages. For example, if you’re currently viewing 20 messages and the oldest is number 2912, you could append “?older_than=2912″ to your request to get the 20 messages prior to those you’re seeing. |
| newer_then |integer |no |query |none |Returns messages newer than the message ID specified as a numeric string. This should be used when polling for new messages. If you’re looking at messages, and the most recent message returned is 3516, you can make a request with the parameter “?newer_than=3516″ to ensure that you do not get duplicate copies of messages already on your page. |
