# Get started with the Google Drive connector
Connect to Google Drive to create files, get rows, and more. The Google Drive connector can be used from:

* Logic apps 
* PowerApps

> [!div class="op_single_selector"]
> * [Logic apps](connectors-create-api-googledrive.md)
> * [PowerApps Enterprise](../power-apps/powerapps-create-api-googledrive.md)
> 
> 

With Google Drive, you can: 

* Build your business flow based on the data you get from your search. 
* Use actions to search images, search the news, and more. These actions get a response, and then make the output available for other actions. For example, you can search for a video, and then use Twitter to post that video to a Twitter feed.
* Add the Google Drive connector to PowerApps Enterprise. Then, your users can use this connector within their apps. 

For information on how to add a connector in PowerApps Enterprise, go to [Register a connector in PowerApps](../power-apps/powerapps-register-from-available-apis.md). 

To add an operation in logic apps, see [Create a logic app](../app-service-logic/app-service-logic-create-a-logic-app.md).

## Triggers and actions
Google Drive includes the following actions. There are no triggers. 

| Triggers | Actions |
| --- | --- |
| None |<ul><li>Create file</li><li>Insert row</li><li>Copy file</li><li>Delete file</li><li>Delete row</li><li>Extract archive to folder</li><li>Get file content using id</li><li>Get file content using path</li><li>Get file metadata using id</li><li>Get file metadata using path</li><li>Get row</li><li>Update file</li><li>Update row</li></ul> |

All connectors support data in JSON and XML formats.

## Create the connection to Google Drive
When you add this connector to your logic apps, you must authorize logic apps to connect to your Google Drive.

> [!INCLUDE [Steps to create a connection to googledrive](../../includes/connectors-create-api-googledrive.md)]
> 
> 

After you create the connection, you enter the Google Drive properties, like the folder path or file name. The **REST API reference** in this topic describes these properties.

> [!TIP]
> You can use this same Google Drive connection in other logic apps.
> 
>
