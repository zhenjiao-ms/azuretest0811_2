# Securing your SQL Database
## Overview
This article walks through the basics of securing the data tier of an application using Azure SQL Database. In particular, this article will get you started with resources for limiting access, protecting data, and monitoring activities on a database created in the [Get started with SQL Database tutorial](sql-database-get-started.md). For a complete overview of security features available on all flavors of SQL, see the [Security Center for SQL Server Database Engine and Azure SQL Database](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bb510589). Additional information is also available in the [Security and Azure SQL Database technical white paper](https://download.microsoft.com/download/A/C/3/AC305059-2B3F-4B08-9952-34CDCA8115A9/Security_and_Azure_SQL_Database_White_paper.pdf) (PDF).

## Connection security
Connection Security refers to how you restrict and secure connections to your database using firewall rules and connection encryption.

Firewall rules are used by both the server and the database to reject connection attempts from IP addresses that have not been explicitly whitelisted. To allow your application or client machine's public IP address to attempt connecting to a new database, you must first create a server-level firewall rule using the Azure Classic Portal, REST API, or PowerShell. As a best practice, you should restrict the IP address ranges allowed through your server firewall as much as possible. For more information, see [Azure SQL Database Firewall](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ee621782).

All connections to Azure SQL Database require encryption (SSL/TLS) at all times while data is "in transit" to and from the database. In your application's connection string, you must specify parameters to encrypt the connection and *not* to trust the server certificate (this is done for you if you copy your connection string out of the Azure Classic Portal), otherwise the connection will not verify the identity of the server and will be susceptible to "man-in-the-middle" attacks. For the ADO.NET driver, for instance, these connection string parameters are **Encrypt=True** and **TrustServerCertificate=False**. For more information, see [Azure SQL Database Connection Encryption and Certificate Validation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/ff394108#encryption).

## Authentication
Authentication refers to how you prove your identity when connecting to the database. SQL Database supports two types of authentication:

* **SQL Authentication**, which uses a username and password
* **Azure Active Directory Authentication**, which uses identities managed by Azure Active Directory and is supported for managed and integrated domains

When you created the logical server for your database, you specified a "server admin" login with a username and password. Using these credentials, you can authenticate to any database on that server as the database owner, or "dbo." If you want to use Azure Active Directory Authentication, you must create another server admin called the "Azure AD admin," which is allowed to administer Azure AD users and groups. This admin can also perform all operations that a regular server admin can. See [Connecting to SQL Database By Using Azure Active Directory Authentication](sql-database-aad-authentication.md) for a walkthrough of how to create an Azure AD admin to enable Azure Active Directory Authentication.

As a best practice your application should use a different account to authenticate -- this way you can limit the permissions granted to the application and reduce the risks of malicious activity in case your application code is vulnerable to a SQL injection attack. The recommended approach is to create a [contained database user](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ff929188), which allows your app to authenticate directly to a single database. You can create a contained database user that uses SQL Authentication by executing the following T-SQL command while connected to your user database as the server admin login:

```
CREATE USER ApplicationUser WITH PASSWORD = 'strong_password'; -- SQL Authentication
```

If you created an Azure AD admin, you can create a contained database user that uses Azure Active Directory Authentication by executing the following T-SQL command while connected to your user database as the Azure AD admin:

```
CREATE USER [Azure_AD_principal_name | Azure_AD_group_display_name] FROM EXTERNAL PROVIDER; -- Azure Active Directory Authentication
```

In either case, your application's connection string should specify these user credentials, rather than the server admin login, to connect to the database.

For more information on authenticating to a SQL Database, see [Managing Databases and Logins in Azure SQL Database](sql-database-manage-logins.md).

## Authorization
Authorization refers to what you can do within an Azure SQL Database, and this is controlled by your user account's role memberships and permissions. As a best practice, you should grant users the least privileges necessary. Azure SQL Database makes this easy to manage with roles in T-SQL:

```
ALTER ROLE db_datareader ADD MEMBER ApplicationUser; -- allows ApplicationUser to read data
ALTER ROLE db_datawriter ADD MEMBER ApplicationUser; -- allows ApplicationUser to write data
```

The server admin account you are connecting with is a member of db_owner, which has authority to do anything within the database. Save this account for deploying schema upgrades and other management operations. Use the "ApplicationUser" account with more limited permissions to connect from your application to the database with the least privileges needed by your application.

There are ways to further limit what a user can do with Azure SQL Database:

* [Database Roles](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms189121) other than db_datareader and db_datawriter can be used to create more powerful application user accounts or less powerful management accounts.
* Granular [Permissions](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms191291) let you control which operations you can do on individual columns, tables, views, procedures, and other objects in the database.
* [Impersonation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/vstudio/bb669087) and [module-signing](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bb669102) can be used to securely elevate permissions temporarily.
* [Row-Level Security](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn765131) can be used limit which rows a user can access.
* [Data Masking](sql-database-dynamic-data-masking-get-started.md) can be used to limit exposure of sensitive data.
* [Stored procedures](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms190782) can be used to limit the actions that can be taken on the database.

Managing databases and logical servers from the Azure Classic Portal or using the Azure Resource Manager API is controlled by your portal user account's role assignments. For more information on this topic, see [Role-based access control in Azure Portal](../active-directory/role-based-access-control-configure.md).

## Encryption
Azure SQL Database can help protect your data by encrypting your data when it is "at rest," or stored in database files and backups, using [Transparent Data Encryption](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=526242). To encrypt your database, connect as a database owner and execute:

```
ALTER DATABASE [AdventureWorks] SET ENCRYPTION ON;
```

For other ways to encrypt your data secrets, consider:

* [Cell-level encryption](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms179331.aspx) to encrypt specific columns or even cells of data with different encryption keys.
* If you need a Hardware Security Module or central management of your encryption key hierarchy, consider using [Azure Key Vault with SQL Server in an Azure VM](http://blogs.technet.com/b/kv/archive/2015/01/12/using-the-key-vault-for-sql-server-encryption.aspx).
* [Always Encrypted](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt163865.aspx) (in preview) makes encryption transparent to applications and allows clients to encrypt sensitive data inside client applications without sharing the encryption keys with SQL Database.

## Auditing
Auditing and tracking database events can help you maintain regulatory compliance and identify suspicious activity. SQL Database Auditing allows you to record events in your database to an audit log in your Azure Storage account. SQL Database Auditing also integrates with Microsoft Power BI to facilitate drill-down reports and analyses. For more information, see [Get started with SQL Database Auditing](sql-database-auditing-get-started.md).

SQL Database Threat Detection provides an additional layer of security on top of Auditing. It enables you to respond to threats as they occur by providing security alerts on anomalous activities. For more information, see [Get started with SQL Database Threat Detection](sql-database-threat-detection-get-started.md).  

## Compliance
In addition to the above features and functionality that can help your application meet various security compliance requirements, Azure SQL Database also participates in regular audits and has been certified against a number of compliance standards. For more information, see the [Microsoft Azure Trust Center](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/trust-center/), where you can find the most current list of [SQL Database compliance certifications](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/trust-center/services/).
