# Azure SQL Database Transact-SQL differences
Most of the Transact-SQL features that applications depend on are supported in both Microsoft SQL Server and Azure SQL Database. A partial list of supported features for applications follows:

* Data types.
* Operators.
* String, arithmetic, logical, and cursor functions.

However, Azure SQL Database is designed to isolate features from any dependency on the **master** database. As a consequence many server-level activities are inappropriate for SQL Database and are unsupported. This topic details the features that are not fully supported in SQL Database.

Also, features that are deprecated in SQL Server are generally not supported in SQL Database.

## Upgrading to SQL Database V12
This topic discusses the features that are available with SQL Database when upgraded to the free SQL Database V12. For more information about V12, see [SQL Database V12 What's New](sql-database-v12-whats-new.md). SQL Database V12 adds performance and manageability improvements, as well as support for additional features. The added features are listed below, separated into the features that are fully supported, and the features that are partially supported. 

## Features partially supported in SQL Database V12
SQL Database V12 supports some but not all of the arguments that exist in the corresponding SQL Server 2016 Transact-SQL statements. For example, the CREATE PROCEDURE statement is available however all of the options of CREATE PROCEDURE are not available. Refer to the linked syntax topics for details about the supported areas of each statement.

* Databases: [CREATE](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn268335.aspx)/[ALTER](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms174269.aspx)
* DMV's are generally available for features that are available
* Functions: [CREATE](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms186755.aspx)/[ALTER FUNCTION](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms186967.aspx)
* [KILL](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms173730.aspx) 
* Logins: [CREATE](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms189751.aspx)/[ALTER LOGIN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms189828.aspx)
* Stored procedures: [CREATE](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms187926.aspx)/[ALTER PROCEDURE](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms189762.aspx)
* Tables: [CREATE](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn305849.aspx)/[ALTER](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms190273.aspx)
* Types (custom): [CREATE TYPE](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms175007.aspx)
* Users: [CREATE](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms173463.aspx)/[ALTER USER](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms176060.aspx)
* Views: [CREATE](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms187956.aspx)/[ALTER VIEW](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms173846.aspx)

## Features not supported in SQL Database
* Collation of system objects
* Connection related: Endpoint statements, ORIGINAL_DB_NAME. Windows authentication is not available for logins or contained database users.
* Cross database queries using three or four part names. (Read-only cross-database queries are supported by using [elastic database query](sql-database-elastic-query-overview.md).)
* Cross database ownership chaining, TRUSTWORTHY setting
* Data Collector
* Database Diagrams
* Database Mail
* DATABASEPROPERTY (use DATABASEPROPERTYEX instead)
* EXECUTE AS logins
* Encryption: extensible key management
* Eventing: events, event notifications, query notifications
* Features related to database file placement, size, and database files which are automatically managed by Microsoft Azure.
* Features that relate to high availability which is managed through your Microsoft Azure account: backup, restore, AlwaysOn, database mirroring, log shipping, recovery modes. For more information, see Azure SQL Database Backup and Restore.
* Features that rely upon the log reader running on SQL Database: Push Replication, Change Data Capture.
* Features that rely upon the SQL Server Agent or the MSDB database: jobs, alerts, operators, Policy-Based Management, database mail, central management servers.
* FILESTREAM
* Functions: fn_get_sql, fn_virtualfilestats, fn_virtualservernodes
* Global temporary tables
* Hardware related server settings: memory, worker threads, CPU affinity, trace flags, etc. Use service levels instead.
* HAS_DBACCESS
* KILL STATS JOB
* Linked servers, OPENQUERY, OPENROWSET, OPENDATASOURCE, BULK INSERT, 3 and 4 part names
* Master/target servers
* .NET Framework [CLR integration with SQL Server](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms254963.aspx)
* Resource governor
* Semantic search
* Server credentials
* Sever-level items: Server roles, IS_SRVROLEMEMBER, sys.login_token. Server level permissions are not available though some are replaced by database-level permissions. Some server-level DMV's are not available though some are replaced by database-level DMV's.
* Serverless express: localdb, user instances
* Service broker
* SET REMOTE_PROC_TRANSACTIONS
* SHUTDOWN
* sp_addmessage
* sp_configure options and RECONFIGURE
* sp_helpuser
* sp_migrate_user_to_contained
* SQL Server audit (use SQL Database auditing instead)
* SQL Server Profiler
* SQL Server trace
* Trace flags
* Transact-SQL debugging
* Triggers: Server-scoped or logon triggers
* USE statement: To change the database context to a different database you must make a new connection to the new database.

## Full Transact-SQL reference
For more information about Transact-SQL grammar, usage, and examples, see [Transact-SQL Reference (Database Engine)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bb510741.aspx) in SQL Server Books Online. 

### About the "Applies to" tags
The Transact-SQL reference includes topics related to SQL Server versions 2008 to the present. Under the topic title there is usually an "Applies to" line which lists SQL Server versions, and perhaps other product names too. Often the same "Applies to" tags also lists Azure SQL Database. If an "Applies to" does not list Azure SQL Database, the topic content does not apply to Azure SQL Database. Sometimes you might see an "Applies to" line which lists multiple products, each with a small icon to indicate whether topic applies to each product.

 For example, availability groups were introduced in SQL Server 2012. The **CREATE AVAILABILTY GROUP** topic indicates it applies to **SQL Server (SQL Server 2012 through current version)** because it does not apply to SQL Server 2008, SQL Server 2008 R2, or to Azure SQL Database.

In some cases, the general subject of a topic can be used in a product, but there are minor differences between products. The differences are indicated at midpoints in the topic as appropriate.
