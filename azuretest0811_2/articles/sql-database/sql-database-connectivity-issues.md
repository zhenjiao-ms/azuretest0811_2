# Troubleshoot, diagnose, and prevent SQL connection errors and transient errors for SQL Database
This article describes how to prevent, troubleshoot, diagnose, and mitigate connection errors and transient errors that your client application encounters when it interacts with Azure SQL Database. Learn how to configure retry logic, build the connection string, and adjust other connection settings.

<a id="i-transient-faults" name="i-transient-faults"></a>

## Transient errors (transient faults)
A transient error - also, transient fault - has an underlying cause that will soon resolve itself. An occasional cause of transient errors is when the Azure system quickly shifts hardware resources to better load-balance various workloads. Most of these reconfiguration events often complete in less than 60 seconds. During this reconfiguration time span, you may have connectivity issues to Azure SQL Database. Applications connecting to Azure SQL Database should be built to expect these transient errors, handle them by implementing retry logic in their code instead of surfacing them to users as application errors.

If your client program is using ADO.NET, your program is told about the transient error by the throw of an **SqlException**. The **Number** property can be compared against the list of transient errors near the top of the topic:
[SQL error codes for SQL Database client applications](sql-database-develop-error-messages.md).

<a id="connection-versus-command" name="connection-versus-command"></a>

### Connection versus command
You'll retry the SQL connection or establish it again, depending on the following:

* **A transient error occurs during a connection try**: The connection should be retried after delaying for several seconds.
* **A transient error occurs during an SQL query command**: The command should not be immediately retried. Instead, after a delay, the connection should be freshly established. Then the command can be retried.

<a id="j-retry-logic-transient-faults" name="j-retry-logic-transient-faults"></a>

### Retry logic for transient errors
Client programs that occasionally encounter a transient error are more robust when they contain retry logic.

When your program communicates with Azure SQL Database through a 3rd party middleware, inquire with the vendor whether the middleware contains retry logic for transient errors.

<a id="principles-for-retry" name="principles-for-retry"></a>

#### Principles for retry
* An attempt to open a connection should be retried if the error is transient.
* An SQL SELECT statement that fails with a transient error should not be retried directly.
  
  * Instead, establish a fresh connection, and then retry the SELECT.
* When an SQL UPDATE statement fails with a transient error, a fresh connection should be established before the UPDATE is retried.
  
  * The retry logic must ensure that either the entire database transaction completed, or that the entire transaction is rolled back.

#### Other considerations for retry
* A batch program that is automatically started after work hours, and which will complete before morning, can afford to very patient with long time intervals between its retry attempts.
* A user interface program should account for the human tendency to give up after too long a wait.
  
  * However, the solution must not be to retry every few seconds, because that policy can flood the system with requests.

#### Interval increase between retries
We recommend that you delay for 5 seconds before your first retry. Retrying after a delay shorter than 5 seconds risks overwhelming the cloud service. For each subsequent retry the delay should grow exponentially, up to a maximum of 60 seconds.

A discussion of the *blocking period* for clients that use ADO.NET is available in [SQL Server Connection Pooling (ADO.NET)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/8xx3tyca.aspx).

You might also want to set a maximum number of retries before the program self-terminates.

#### Code samples with retry logic
Code samples with retry logic, in a variety of programming languages, are available at:

* [Connection libraries for SQL Database and SQL Server](sql-database-libraries.md)

<a id="k-test-retry-logic" name="k-test-retry-logic"></a>

#### Test your retry logic
To test your retry logic, you must simulate or cause an error than can be corrected while your program is still running.

##### Test by disconnecting from the network
One way you can test your retry logic is to disconnect your client computer from the network while the program is running. The error will be:

* **SqlException.Number** = 11001
* Message: "No such host is known"

As part of the first retry attempt, your program can correct the misspelling, and then attempt to connect.

To make this practical, you unplug your computer from the network before you start your program. Then your program recognizes a run time parameter that causes the program to:

1. Temporarily add 11001 to its list of errors to consider as transient.
2. Attempt its first connection as usual.
3. After the error is caught, remove 11001 from the list.
4. Display a message telling the user to plug the computer into the network.
   * Pause further execution by using either the **Console.ReadLine** method or a dialog with an OK button. The user presses the Enter key after the computer plugged into the network.
5. Attempt again to connect, expecting success.

##### Test by misspelling the database name when connecting
Your program can purposely misspell the user name before the first connection attempt. The error will be:

* **SqlException.Number** = 18456
* Message: "Login failed for user 'WRONG_MyUserName'."

As part of the first retry attempt, your program can correct the misspelling, and then attempt to connect.

To make this practical, your program could recognize a run time parameter that causes the program to:

1. Temporarily add 18456 to its list of errors to consider as transient.
2. Purposely add 'WRONG_' to the user name.
3. After the error is caught, remove 18456 from the list.
4. Remove 'WRONG_' from the user name.
5. Attempt again to connect, expecting success.

<a id="net-sqlconnection-parameters-for-connection-retry" name="net-sqlconnection-parameters-for-connection-retry"></a>

### .NET SqlConnection parameters for connection retry
If your client program connects to to Azure SQL Database by using the .NET Framework class **System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnection**, you should use .NET 4.6.1 or later so you can leverage its connection retry feature. Details of the feature are [here](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=393996).

<!--
2015-11-30, FwLink 393996 points to dn632678.aspx, which links to a downloadable .docx related to SqlClient and SQL Server 2014.
-->


When you build the [connection string](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnection.connectionstring.aspx) for your **SqlConnection** object, you should coordinate the values among the following parameters:

* ConnectRetryCount &nbsp;&nbsp;*(Default is 1. Range is 0 through 255.)*
* ConnectRetryInterval &nbsp;&nbsp;*(Default is 1 second. Range is 1 through 60.)*
* Connection Timeout &nbsp;&nbsp;*(Default is 15 seconds. Range is 0 through 2147483647)*

Specifically, your chosen values should make the following equality true:

* Connection Timeout = ConnectRetryCount * ConnectionRetryInterval

For example, if the count = 3, and interval = 10 seconds, a timeout of only 29 seconds would not quite give the system enough time for its 3rd and final retry at connecting: 29 < 3 * 10.

<a id="connection-versus-command" name="connection-versus-command"></a>

### Connection versus command
The **ConnectRetryCount** and **ConnectRetryInterval** parameters let your **SqlConnection** object retry the connect operation without telling or bothering your program, such as returning control to your program. The retries can occur in the following situations:

* mySqlConnection.Open method call
* mySqlConnection.Execute method call

There is a subtlety. If a transient error occurs while your *query* is being executed, your **SqlConnection** object does not retry the connect operation, and it certainly does not retry your query. However, **SqlConnection** very quickly checks the connection before sending your query for execution. If the quick check detects a connection problem, **SqlConnection** retries the connect operation. If the retry succeeds, you query is sent for execution.

#### Should ConnectRetryCount be combined with application retry logic?
Suppose your application has robust custom retry logic. It might retry the connect operation 4 times. If you add **ConnectRetryInterval** and **ConnectRetryCount** =3 to your connection string, you will increase the retry count to 4 * 3 = 12 retries. You might not intend such a high number of retries.

## Connections to Azure SQL Database
<a id="c-connection-string" name="c-connection-string"></a>

### Connection: Connection string
The connection string necessary for connecting to Azure SQL Database is slightly different from the string for connecting to Microsoft SQL Server. You can copy the connection string for your database from the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

[!INCLUDE [sql-database-include-connection-string-20-portalshots](../../includes/sql-database-include-connection-string-20-portalshots.md)]

<a id="b-connection-ip-address" name="b-connection-ip-address"></a>

### Connection: IP address
You must configure the SQL Database server to accept communication from the IP address of the computer that hosts your client program. You do this by editing the firewall settings through the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

If you forget to configure the IP address, your program will fail with a handy error message that states the necessary IP address.

[!INCLUDE [sql-database-include-ip-address-22-v12portal](../../includes/sql-database-include-ip-address-22-v12portal.md)]

For more information, see:
[How to: Configure firewall settings on SQL Database](sql-database-configure-firewall-settings.md)

<a id="c-connection-ports" name="c-connection-ports"></a>

### Connection: Ports
Typically you only need to ensure that port 1433 is open for outbound communication, on the computer that hosts you client program.

For example, when your client program is hosted on a Windows computer, the Windows Firewall on the host enables you to open port 1433:

1. Open the Control Panel
2. &gt; All Control Panel Items
3. &gt; Windows Firewall
4. &gt; Advanced Settings
5. &gt; Outbound Rules
6. &gt; Actions
7. &gt; New Rule

If your client program is hosted on an Azure virtual machine (VM), you should read:<br/>[Ports beyond 1433 for ADO.NET 4.5 and SQL Database V12](sql-database-develop-direct-route-ports-adonet-v12.md).

For background information about cofiguration of ports and IP address, see:
[Azure SQL Database firewall](sql-database-firewall-configure.md)

<a id="d-connection-ado-net-4-5" name="d-connection-ado-net-4-5"></a>

### Connection: ADO.NET 4.6.1
If your program uses ADO.NET classes like **System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnection** to connect to Azure SQL Database, we recommend that you use .NET Framework version 4.6.1 or higher.

ADO.NET 4.6.1:

* For Azure SQL Database, there is improved reliability when you open a connection by using the **SqlConnection.Open** method. The **Open** method now incorporates best effort retry mechanisms in response to transient faults, for certain errors within the Connection Timeout period.
* Supports connection pooling. This includes an efficient verification that the connection object it gives your program is functioning.

When you use a connection object from a connection pool, we recommend that your program temporarily close the connection when not immediately using it. Re-opening a connection is not expensive the way creating a new connection is.

If you are using ADO.NET 4.0 or earlier, we recommend that you upgrade to the latest ADO.NET.

* As of November 2015, you can [download ADO.NET 4.6.1](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dotnet/archive/2015/11/30/net-framework-4-6-1-is-now-available.aspx).

## Diagnostics
<a id="d-test-whether-utilities-can-connect" name="d-test-whether-utilities-can-connect"></a>

### Diagnostics: Test whether utilities can connect
If your program is failing to connect to Azure SQL Database, one diagnostic option is to try to connect with a utility program. Ideally the utility would connect by using the same library that your program uses.

On any Windows computer, you can try these utilities:

* SQL Server Management Studio (ssms.exe), which connects by using ADO.NET.
* sqlcmd.exe, which connects by using [ODBC](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/jj730308.aspx).

Once connected, test whether a short SQL SELECT query works.

<a id="f-diagnostics-check-open-ports" name="f-diagnostics-check-open-ports"></a>

### Diagnostics: Check the open ports
Suppose you suspect that connection attempts are failing due to port issues. On your computer you can run a utility that reports on the port configurations.

On Linux the following utilities might be helpful:

* `netstat -nap`
* `nmap -sS -O 127.0.0.1`
  * (Change the example value to be your IP address.)

On Windows the [PortQry.exe](http://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=17148) utility might be helpful. Here is an example execution that queried the port situation on an Azure SQL Database server, and which was run on a laptop computer:

```
[C:\Users\johndoe\]
>> portqry.exe -n johndoesvr9.database.windows.net -p tcp -e 1433

Querying target system called:
 johndoesvr9.database.windows.net

Attempting to resolve name to IP address...
Name resolved to 23.100.117.95

querying...
TCP port 1433 (ms-sql-s service): LISTENING

[C:\Users\johndoe\]
>>
```

### Diagnostics: Log your errors
An intermittent problem is sometimes best diagnosed by detection of a general pattern over days or weeks.

Your client can assist in a diagnosis by logging all errors it encounters. You might be able to correlate the log entries with error data that Azure SQL Database logs itself internally.

Enterprise Library 6 (EntLib60) offers .NET managed classes to assist with logging:

* [5 - As Easy As Falling Off a Log: Using the Logging Application Block](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn440731.aspx)

<a id="h-diagnostics-examine-logs-errors" name="h-diagnostics-examine-logs-errors"></a>

### Diagnostics: Examine system logs for errors
Here are some Transact-SQL SELECT statements that query logs of error and other information.

| Query of log | Description |
|:--- |:--- |
| `SELECT e.*`<br/>`FROM sys.event_log AS e`<br/>`WHERE e.database_name = 'myDbName'`<br/>`AND e.event_category = 'connectivity'`<br/>`AND 2 >= DateDiff`<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;`(hour, e.end_time, GetUtcDate())`<br/>`ORDER BY e.event_category,`<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;`e.event_type, e.end_time;` |The [sys.event_log](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn270018.aspx) view offers information about individual events, including some that can cause transient errors or connectivity failures.<br/><br/>Ideally you can correlate the **start_time** or **end_time** values with information about when your client program experienced problems.<br/><br/>**TIP:** You must connect to the **master** database to run this. |
| `SELECT c.*`<br/>`FROM sys.database_connection_stats AS c`<br/>`WHERE c.database_name = 'myDbName'`<br/>`AND 24 >= DateDiff`<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;`(hour, c.end_time, GetUtcDate())`<br/>`ORDER BY c.end_time;` |The [sys.database_connection_stats](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn269986.aspx) view offers aggregated counts of event types, for additional diagnostics.<br/><br/>**TIP:** You must connect to the **master** database to run this. |

<a id="d-search-for-problem-events-in-the-sql-database-log" name="d-search-for-problem-events-in-the-sql-database-log"></a>

### Diagnostics: Search for problem events in the SQL Database log
You can search for entries about problem events in the log of Azure SQL Database. Try the following Transact-SQL SELECT statement in the **master** database:

```
SELECT
   object_name
  ,CAST(f.event_data as XML).value
      ('(/event/@timestamp)[1]', 'datetime2')                      AS [timestamp]
  ,CAST(f.event_data as XML).value
      ('(/event/data[@name="error"]/value)[1]', 'int')             AS [error]
  ,CAST(f.event_data as XML).value
      ('(/event/data[@name="state"]/value)[1]', 'int')             AS [state]
  ,CAST(f.event_data as XML).value
      ('(/event/data[@name="is_success"]/value)[1]', 'bit')        AS [is_success]
  ,CAST(f.event_data as XML).value
      ('(/event/data[@name="database_name"]/value)[1]', 'sysname') AS [database_name]
FROM
  sys.fn_xe_telemetry_blob_target_read_file('el', null, null, null) AS f
WHERE
  object_name != 'login_event'  -- Login events are numerous.
  and
  '2015-06-21' < CAST(f.event_data as XML).value
        ('(/event/@timestamp)[1]', 'datetime2')
ORDER BY
  [timestamp] DESC
;
```


#### A few returned rows from sys.fn_xe_telemetry_blob_target_read_file
Next is what a returned row might look like. The null values shown are often not null in other rows.

```
object_name                   timestamp                    error  state  is_success  database_name

## Enterprise Library 6
Enterprise Library 6 (EntLib60) is a framework of .NET classes that helps you implement robust clients of cloud services, one of which is the Azure SQL Database service. You can locate topics dedicated to each area in which EntLib60 can assist by first visiting:

* [Enterprise Library 6 – April 2013](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn169621%28v=pandp.60%29.aspx)

Retry logic for handling transient errors is one area in which EntLib60 can assist:

* [4 - Perseverance, Secret of All Triumphs: Using the Transient Fault Handling Application Block](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn440719%28v=pandp.60%29.aspx)

> [!NOTE]
> The source code for EntLib60 is available for public [download](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=290898). Microsoft has no plans to make further feature updates or maintenance updates to EntLib.

<a id="entlib60-classes-for-transient-errors-and-retry" name="entlib60-classes-for-transient-errors-and-retry"></a>

### EntLib60 classes for transient errors and retry
The following EntLib60 classes are particularly useful for retry logic. All these  are in, or are further under, the namespace **Microsoft.Practices.EnterpriseLibrary.TransientFaultHandling**:

*In the namespace **Microsoft.Practices.EnterpriseLibrary.TransientFaultHandling**:*

* **RetryPolicy** class
  
  * **ExecuteAction** method
* **ExponentialBackoff** class
* **SqlDatabaseTransientErrorDetectionStrategy** class
* **ReliableSqlConnection** class
  
  * **ExecuteCommand** method

In the namespace **Microsoft.Practices.EnterpriseLibrary.TransientFaultHandling.TestSupport**:

* **AlwaysTransientErrorDetectionStrategy** class
* **NeverTransientErrorDetectionStrategy** class

Here are links to information about EntLib60:

* Free [Book Download: Developer's Guide to Microsoft Enterprise Library, 2nd Edition](http://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=41145)
* Best practices: [Retry general guidance](../best-practices-retry-general.md) has an excellent in-depth discussion of retry logic.
* NuGet download of [Enterprise Library - Transient Fault Handling application block 6.0](http://www.nuget.org/packages/EnterpriseLibrary.TransientFaultHandling/)

<a id="entlib60-the-logging-block" name="entlib60-the-logging-block"></a>

### EntLib60: The logging block
* The Logging block is a highly flexible and configurable solution that allows you to:
  
  * Create and store log messages in a wide variety of locations.
  * Categorize and filter messages.
  * Collect contextual information that is useful for debugging and tracing, as well as for auditing and general logging requirements.
* The Logging block abstracts the logging functionality from the log destination so that the application code is consistent, irrespective of the location and type of the target logging store.

### EntLib60 IsTransient method source code
Next, from the **SqlDatabaseTransientErrorDetectionStrategy** class, is the C# source code for the **IsTransient** method. The source code clarifies which errors were considered to be transient and worthy of retry, as of April 2013.

Numerous **//comment** lines have been removed from this copy to emphasize readability.

            // Attach the decoded values as additional attributes to
            // the original SQL exception.
            sqlException.Data[condition.ThrottlingMode.GetType().Name] =
              condition.ThrottlingMode.ToString();
