This article lists SQL error codes for SQL Database client applications, including database connection errors, transient errors (also called transient faults), resource governance errors, database copy issues, elastic pool, and other errors. Most categories are particular to Azure SQL Database, and do not apply to Microsoft SQL Server.

## Database connection errors, transient errors, and other temporary errors
The following table covers the SQL error codes for connection loss errors, and other transient errors you might encounter when your application attempts to access SQL Database. For getting started tutorials on how to connect to Azure SQL Database, see [Connecting to Azure SQL Database](sql-database-libraries.md).

### Most common database connection errors and transient fault errors
The Azure infrastructure has the ability to dynamically reconfigure servers when heavy workloads arise in the SQL Database service.  This dynamic behavior might cause your client program to lose its connection to SQL Database. This kind of error condition is called a *transient fault*.

If your client program has retry logic, it can try to reestablish a connection after giving the transient fault time to correct itself.  We recommend that you delay for 5 seconds before your first retry. Retrying after a delay shorter than 5 seconds risks overwhelming the cloud service. For each subsequent retry the delay should grow exponentially, up to a maximum of 60 seconds.

Transient fault errors typically manifest as one of the following error messages from your client programs:

* Database <db_name> on server <Azure_instance> is not currently available. Please retry the connection later. If the problem persists, contact customer support, and provide them the session tracing ID of <session_id>
* Database <db_name> on server <Azure_instance> is not currently available. Please retry the connection later. If the problem persists, contact customer support, and provide them the session tracing ID of <session_id>. (Microsoft SQL Server, Error: 40613)
* An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host.
* System.Data.Entity.Core.EntityCommandExecutionException: An error occurred while executing the command definition. See the inner exception for details. ---> System.Data.SqlClient.SqlException: A transport-level error has occurred when receiving results from the server. (provider: Session Provider, error: 19 - Physical connection is not usable)

For code examples of retry logic, see:

* [Connection Libraries for SQL Database and SQL Server](sql-database-libraries.md) 
* [Actions to fix connection errors and transient errors in SQL Database](sql-database-connectivity-issues.md)

A discussion of the *blocking period* for clients that use ADO.NET is available in [SQL Server Connection Pooling (ADO.NET)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/8xx3tyca.aspx).

### Transient fault error codes
The following errors are transient, and should be retried in application logic 

| Error code | Severity | Description |
| ---:| ---:|:--- |
| 4060 |16 |Cannot open database "%.&#x2a;ls" requested by the login. The login failed. |
| 40197 |17 |The service has encountered an error processing your request. Please try again. Error code %d.<br/><br/>You will receive this error, when the service is down due to software or hardware upgrades, hardware failures, or any other failover problems. The error code (%d) embedded within the message of error 40197 provides additional information about the kind of failure or failover that occurred. Some examples of the error codes are embedded within the message of error 40197 are 40020, 40143, 40166, and 40540.<br/><br/>Reconnecting to your SQL Database server will automatically connect you to a healthy copy of your database. Your application must catch error 40197, log the embedded error code (%d) within the message for troubleshooting, and try reconnecting to SQL Database until the resources are available, and your connection is established again. |
| 40501 |20 |The service is currently busy. Retry the request after 10 seconds. Incident ID: %ls. Code: %d.<br/><br/>*Note:* For more information, see:<br/>• [Azure SQL Database resource limits](sql-database-resource-limits.md). |
| 40613 |17 |Database '%.&#x2a;ls' on server '%.&#x2a;ls' is not currently available. Please retry the connection later. If the problem persists, contact customer support, and provide them the session tracing ID of '%.&#x2a;ls'. |
| 49918 |16 |Cannot process request. Not enough resources to process request.<br/><br/>The service is currently busy. Please retry the request later. |
| 49919 |16 |Cannot process create or update request. Too many create or update operations in progress for subscription "%ld".<br/><br/>The service is busy processing multiple create or update requests for your subscription or server. Requests are currently blocked for resource optimization. Query [sys.dm_operation_status](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn270022.aspx) for pending operations. Wait till pending create or update requests are complete or delete one of your pending requests and retry your request later. |
| 49920 |16 |Cannot process request. Too many operations in progress for subscription "%ld".<br/><br/>The service is busy processing multiple requests for this subscription. Requests are currently blocked for resource optimization. Query [sys.dm_operation_status](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn270022.aspx) for operation status. Wait until pending requests are complete or delete one of your pending requests and retry your request later. |

## Database copy errors
The following errors can be encountered while copying a database in Azure SQL Database. For more information, see [Copy an Azure SQL Database](sql-database-copy.md).

| Error code | Severity | Description |
| ---:| ---:|:--- |
| 40635 |16 |Client with IP address '%.&#x2a;ls' is temporarily disabled. |
| 40637 |16 |Create database copy is currently disabled. |
| 40561 |16 |Database copy failed. Either the source or target database does not exist. |
| 40562 |16 |Database copy failed. The source database has been dropped. |
| 40563 |16 |Database copy failed. The target database has been dropped. |
| 40564 |16 |Database copy failed due to an internal error. Please drop target database and try again. |
| 40565 |16 |Database copy failed. No more than 1 concurrent database copy from the same source is allowed. Please drop target database and try again later. |
| 40566 |16 |Database copy failed due to an internal error. Please drop target database and try again. |
| 40567 |16 |Database copy failed due to an internal error. Please drop target database and try again. |
| 40568 |16 |Database copy failed. Source database has become unavailable. Please drop target database and try again. |
| 40569 |16 |Database copy failed. Target database has become unavailable. Please drop target database and try again. |
| 40570 |16 |Database copy failed due to an internal error. Please drop target database and try again later. |
| 40571 |16 |Database copy failed due to an internal error. Please drop target database and try again later. |

## Resource governance errors
The following errors are caused by excessive use of resources while working with Azure SQL Database. For example:

* A transaction has been open for too long.
* A transaction is holding too many locks.
* An application is consuming too much memory.
* An application is consuming too much `TempDb` space.

* More detailed information is available here: [Azure SQL Database resource limits](sql-database-resource-limits.md)

| Error code | Severity | Description |
| ---:| ---:|:--- |
| 10928 |20 |Resource ID: %d. The %s limit for the database is %d and has been reached. For more information, see [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=267637](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=267637).<br/><br/>The Resource ID indicates the resource that has reached the limit. For worker threads, the Resource ID = 1. For sessions, the Resource ID = 2.<br/><br/>*Note:* For more information about this error and how to resolve it, see:<br/>• [Azure SQL Database resource limits](sql-database-resource-limits.md). |
| 10929 |20 |Resource ID: %d. The %s minimum guarantee is %d, maximum limit is %d and the current usage for the database is %d. However, the server is currently too busy to support requests greater than %d for this database. For more information, see [http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=267637](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=267637). Otherwise, please try again later.<br/><br/>The Resource ID indicates the resource that has reached the limit. For worker threads, the Resource ID = 1. For sessions, the Resource ID = 2.<br/><br/>*Note:* For more information about this error and how to resolve it, see:<br/>• [Azure SQL Database resource limits](sql-database-resource-limits.md). |
| 40544 |20 |The database has reached its size quota. Partition or delete data, drop indexes, or consult the documentation for possible resolutions. |
| 40549 |16 |Session is terminated because you have a long-running transaction. Try shortening your transaction. |
| 40550 |16 |The session has been terminated because it has acquired too many locks. Try reading or modifying fewer rows in a single transaction. |
| 40551 |16 |The session has been terminated because of excessive `TEMPDB` usage. Try modifying your query to reduce the temporary table space usage.<br/><br/>*Tip:* If you are using temporary objects, conserve space in the `TEMPDB` database by dropping temporary objects after they are no longer needed by the session. |
| 40552 |16 |The session has been terminated because of excessive transaction log space usage. Try modifying fewer rows in a single transaction.<br/><br/>*Tip:* If you perform bulk inserts using the `bcp.exe` utility or the `System.Data.SqlClient.SqlBulkCopy` class, try using the `-b batchsize` or `BatchSize` options to limit the number of rows copied to the server in each transaction. If you are rebuilding an index with the `ALTER INDEX` statement, try using the `REBUILD WITH ONLINE = ON` option. |
| 40553 |16 |The session has been terminated because of excessive memory usage. Try modifying your query to process fewer rows.<br/><br/>*Tip:* Reducing the number of `ORDER BY` and `GROUP BY` operations in your Transact-SQL code reduces the memory requirements of your query. |
