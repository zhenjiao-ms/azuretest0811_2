# Explore Azure SQL Database Solution Quick Starts
This article contains an overview of the Azure SQL Database Solution Quick Starts. These Quick Starts are located in the GitHub SQL Server samples repository and demonstrate the use of SQL Database in a complete solution based on real-world scenarios. For simple step-by-step tutorials that demonstrate the use of a particular SQL Database feature, see [Explore Azure SQL Database tutorials](sql-database-explore-tutorials.md).

## Try the WingTipTickets demo and hands-on lab
The [Azure SQL Database WingTipTickets](https://github.com/microsoft/wingtiptickets) demo and hands-on lab demonstrate an Azure SQL Database and Azure Search-based sample application that's used to sell concert tickets.

## Collect and monitor resource usage data across multiple pools
[Solution Quick Start: Elastic Pool telemetry using PowerShell](https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/tree/master/samples/manage/azure-sql-db-elastic-pools) provides a solution for collecting and monitoring SQL Database resource usage across multiple pools in a subscription. When you have a large number of databases in a subscription, it's cumbersome to monitor each elastic pool separately.

To resolve this issue, you can combine SQL Database PowerShell cmdlets and T-SQL queries to collect resource usage data from multiple pools and their databases. This helps you monitor and analyze resource usage more efficiently.

This Quick Start provides a set of PowerShell scripts and T-SQL queries along with documentation on what the solution does and how to implement it.

## Get started with Elastic Database in an SaaS scenario
 [Solution Quick Start: Elastic Pool custom dashboard for SaaS](https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/tree/master/samples/manage/azure-sql-db-elastic-pools-custom-dashboard) provides a solution for a Software-as-a-Solution (SaaS) scenario that leverages the Elastic Database feature of SQL Database to provide a cost-effective and scalable database backend for an SaaS application.

In this solution, you will walk through the implementation of a web app. This web app lets you visualize the load that's created on an elastic database by a load generator that uses a custom dashboard that supplements the Azure portal.

This Quick Start provides a load generator and monitoring web app along with the documentation about what the app does and how to use it.

## Create an Azure SQL database by using Code First development and the Entity Framework
The video and sample in [Code First to a New Database](https://msdn.microsoft.com/data/jj193542.aspx) provides an introduction to Code First development that targets a new database. This scenario targets a database that doesnâ€™t exist, but which will be created by Code First. Alternatively, the scenario creates an empty database to which Code First adds new tables.

Code First enables you to define your model by using by C# or Visual Basic .NET classes. You can perform optional additional configuration by using attributes on your classes and properties or by using a fluent API.

## Integrate Elastic Database tools into an Entity Framework application
The [Elastic Database client library with Entity Framework](sql-database-elastic-scale-use-entity-framework-applications-visual-studio.md) sample shows the changes that you need to make to an Entity Framework application to integrate it with [Elastic Database tools](sql-database-elastic-scale-get-started.md). The focus is on composing [shard map management](sql-database-elastic-scale-shard-map-management.md) and [data-dependent routing](sql-database-elastic-scale-data-dependent-routing.md) with the Entity Framework Code First approach.

The [Code First to a new database sample for EF](http://msdn.microsoft.com/data/jj193542.aspx) serves as our running example throughout this sample. The sample code that accompanies this document is part of the Elastic Database tools set of samples in the Visual Studio code samples.

## Integrate Elastic Database tools with row-level security
[Multitenant applications with Elastic Database tools and row-level security](sql-database-elastic-tools-multi-tenant-row-level-security.md) shows the changes that you need to make to an Entity Framework application to integrate [Elastic Database tools](sql-database-elastic-scale-get-started.md) with [row-level security](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn765131). This sample illustrates how to use these technologies together to build an application with a highly scalable data tier that supports multitenant shards.

You do this by using ADO.NET SqlClient or Entity Framework. This sample extends the [Elastic Database client library with Entity Framework](sql-database-elastic-scale-use-entity-framework-applications-visual-studio.md) by adding support for multitenant shard databases.
It builds a simple console application for creating blogs and posts, with four tenants and two multitenant shard databases.

## Create online surveys with the Tailspin Surveys application
This [Tailspin Surveys sample application](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/guidance-identity-management-for-multitenant-apps/blob/master/docs/running-the-app.md) is a multitenant web application, called Surveys, that enables users to create online surveys. The sample addresses some key concerns about how to manage user identities in a multitenant application, including sign-up, authentication, authorization, and app roles.

## Learn about the latest security features of SQL Database with the Contoso Clinic Demo Application
This [Contoso Clinic Demo application](https://github.com/Microsoft/azure-sql-security-sample) showcases the latest security features of SQL Database.
