This article shows you how to configure Active Geo-Replication for SQL Database with the [Azure portal](http://portal.azure.com).

To initiate failover with the Azure portal, see [Initiate a planned or unplanned failover for Azure SQL Database with the Azure portal](sql-database-geo-replication-failover-portal.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Active Geo-Replication (readable secondaries) is now available for all databases in all service tiers. In April 2017 the non-readable secondary type will be retired and existing non-readable databases will automatically be upgraded to readable secondaries.
> 
> 

To configure Geo-Replication using the Azure portal, you need the following:

* An Azure subscription. 
* An Azure SQL Database database - The primary database that you want to replicate to a different geographical region.

## Add secondary database
The following steps create a new secondary database in a Geo-Replication partnership.  

To add a secondary you must be the subscription owner or co-owner. 

The secondary database will have the same name as the primary database and will, by default, have the same service level. The secondary database can be readable or non-readable, and can be a single database or an elastic database. For more information, see [Service Tiers](sql-database-service-tiers.md).
After the secondary is created and seeded, data will begin replicating from the primary database to the new secondary database. 

> [!NOTE]
> If the partner database already exists (for example - as a result of terminating a previous Geo-Replication relationship) the command will fail.

### Add secondary
1. In the [Azure portal](http://portal.azure.com) browse to the database that you want to setup for Geo-Replication.
2. On the SQL Database blade, select **All settings** > **Geo-Replication**.
3. Select the region to create the secondary database.

    ![Add secondary][1]


1. Configure the **Secondary type** (**Readable**, or **Non-readable**).
2. Select or configure the server for the secondary database.
   
    ![Create Secondary](./media/sql-database-geo-replication-portal/create-secondary.png)
3. Optionally, you can add a secondary database to an elastic database pool:
   
       - Click **Elastic database pool** and select a pool on the target server to create the secondary database in. A pool must already exist on the target server as this workflow does not create a new pool.
4. Click **Create** to add the secondary.
5. The secondary database is created and the seeding process begins. 
   
    ![seeding](./media/sql-database-geo-replication-portal/seeding0.png)
6. When the seeding process is complete the secondary database displays its status (non-readable.
   
    ![secondary ready](./media/sql-database-geo-replication-portal/seeding-complete.png)

## Remove secondary database
The operation permanently terminates the replication to the secondary database and change the role of the secondary to a regular read-write database. If the connectivity to the secondary database is broken the command succeeds but the secondary will not become read-write until after connectivity is restored.  

1. In the [Azure portal](http://portal.azure.com) browse to the primary database in the Geo-Replication partnership.
2. On the SQL Database blade, select **All settings** > **Geo-Replication**.
3. In the **SECONDARIES** list select the database you want to remove from the Geo-Replication partnership.
4. Click **Stop Replication**.
   
    ![remove secondary](./media/sql-database-geo-replication-portal/remove-secondary.png)
5. Clicking **Stop Replication** opens a confirmation window so click **Yes** to remove the database from the Geo-Replication partnership (set it to a read-write database not part of any replication).

    ![confirm removal][8]
