# Connect to SQL Database by using PHP on Windows
[!INCLUDE [sql-database-develop-includes-selector-language-platform-depth](../../includes/sql-database-develop-includes-selector-language-platform-depth.md)]

This topic illustrates how you can connect to Azure SQL Database from a client application written in PHP that runs on Windows.

## Step 1:  Configure Development Environment
[Configure development environment for PHP development](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt720663.aspx)

## Step 2: Create a SQL database
See the [getting started page](sql-database-get-started.md) to learn how to create a sample database.  It is important you follow the guide to create an **AdventureWorks database template**. The samples shown below only work with the **AdventureWorks schema**.

## Step 3: Get Connection Details
