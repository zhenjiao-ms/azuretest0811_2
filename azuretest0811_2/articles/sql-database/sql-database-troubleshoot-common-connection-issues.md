# Troubleshoot connection issues to Azure SQL Database
When the connection to Azure SQL Database fails, you receive [error messages](sql-database-develop-error-messages.md). This article is a centralized topic that helps you troubleshoot Azure SQL Database connectivity issues. It introduces [the common causes](#cause) of connection issues, recommends [a troubleshooting tool](#try-the-troubleshooter-for-azure-sql-database-connectivity-issues) that helps you identity the problem, and provides troubleshooting steps to solve [transient errors](#troubleshoot-transient-errors) and [persistent or non-transient errors](#troubleshoot-the-persistent-errors). Finally, it lists [all the relevant articles for Azure SQL Database connectivity issues](#all-topics-for-azure-sql-database-connection-problems).

If you encounter the connection issues, try the troubleshoot steps that are described in this article.
[!INCLUDE [support-disclaimer](../../includes/support-disclaimer.md)]

## Cause
Connection problems may be caused by any of the following:

* Failure to apply best practices and design guidelines during the application design process.  See [SQL Database Development Overview](sql-database-develop-overview.md) to get started.
* Azure SQL Database reconfiguration
* Firewall settings
* Connection time-out
* Incorrect login information
* Maximum limit reached on some Azure SQL Database resources

Generally, connection issues to Azure SQL Database can be classified as follows:

* [Transient errors (short-lived or intermittent)](#troubleshoot-transient-errors)
* [Persistent or non-transient errors (errors that regularly recur)](#troubleshoot-the-persistent-errors)

## Try the troubleshooter for Azure SQL Database connectivity issues
If you encounter a specific connection error, try [this tool](https://support.microsoft.com/help/10085/troubleshooting-connectivity-issues-with-microsoft-azure-sql-database), which will help you quickly identity and resolve your problem.

## Troubleshoot transient errors
If your application is experiencing transient errors, review the following topics for tips about how to troubleshoot and reduce the frequency of these errors:

* [Troubleshooting Database &lt;x&gt; on Server &lt;y&gt; is unavailable (Error: 40613)](sql-database-troubleshoot-connection.md)
* [Troubleshoot, diagnose, and prevent SQL connection errors and transient errors for SQL Database](sql-database-connectivity-issues.md)

## Troubleshoot persistent errors (non-transient errors)
If the application persistently fails to connect to Azure SQL Database, it usually indicates an issue with one of the following:

* Firewall configuration. The Azure SQL database or client-side firewall is blocking connections to Azure SQL Database.
* Network reconfiguration on the client side: for example, a new IP address or a proxy server.
* User error: for example, mistyped connection parameters, such as the server name in the connection string.

### Steps to resolve persistent connectivity issues
1. Set up [firewall rules](sql-database-configure-firewall-settings.md) to allow the client IP address.
2. On all firewalls between the client and the Internet, make sure that port 1433 is open for outbound connections. Review [Configure the Windows Firewall to Allow SQL Server Access](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/cc646023.aspx) for additional pointers.
3. Verify your connection string and other connection settings. See the Connection String section in the [connectivity issues topic](sql-database-connectivity-issues.md#connections-to-azure-sql-database).
4. Check service health in the dashboard. If you think thereâ€™s a regional outage, see [Recover from an outage](sql-database-disaster-recovery.md) for steps to recover to a new region.
