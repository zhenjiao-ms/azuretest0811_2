# Restore a database to a previous point in time, restore a deleted database, or recover from a data center outage
SQL Database keeps replicas of your database so you can recover from outages and user error. Available options depend on the database service tier and options you choose. See the [Business Continuity Overview](sql-database-business-continuity.md) for details and design considerations.

## To restore a database to a previous point in time
1. In the [Azure Portal](https://azure.microsoft.com/), click **SQL databases**.
2. Select your database from the list and then click **Restore**.
3. Type a new name for the database, choose the date and time to restore from, and then click **Create.**
4. Make app adjustments as necessary to reference the new database. See [Recover a database to a point in time](sql-database-recovery-using-backups.md#point-in-time-restore).

## To restore an accidentally deleted database
1. In the [Azure Portal](https://azure.microsoft.com/), click **SQL servers**.
2. Select the server that hosted the database from the list.
3. On the Server blade, scroll down and click **Deleted databases**.
4. Select the database to restore, and then click **Create**.
5. Make app adjustments as necessary to reference the new database. See [Recover a deleted database](sql-database-recovery-using-backups.md#deleted-database-restore).

## To recover from a regional datacenter outage
With Standard and Premium databases, if you set up geo-replicated secondaries, you can recover using these secondaries. This gives you the ability to restore a database with a less potential for data loss. See [Recover an Azure SQL database using automated database backups](sql-database-disaster-recovery.md) for details.

Azure also provides backups of every database in a different region (a geo-redundant backup). You can create a new database from these backups, which is called Geo-restore, but it's likely that you'll experience data loss if you rely on this method alone.

**To recover a database using geo-restore:**

* In the [Azure Portal](https://azure.microsoft.com/), click **New**, click **Data and Storage**, click **SQL Database**, and then select **Backup** as the database source. See [Recover an Azure SQL database from an outage](sql-database-disaster-recovery.md) for details.
