# Connect to SQL Database by using Java with JDBC on Windows
[!INCLUDE [sql-database-develop-includes-selector-language-platform-depth](../../includes/sql-database-develop-includes-selector-language-platform-depth.md)]

This topic presents a Java code sample that you can use to connect to Azure SQL Database. The Java sample relies on the Java Development Kit (JDK) version 1.8. The sample connects to an Azure SQL Database by using the JDBC driver.

## Step 1:  Configure Development Environment
[Configure development environment for Java development](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt720658.aspx)

## Step 2: Create a SQL database
See the [getting started page](sql-database-get-started.md) to learn how to create a database.  

## Step 3: Get Connection String
[!INCLUDE [sql-database-include-connection-string-jdbc-20-portalshots](../../includes/sql-database-include-connection-string-jdbc-20-portalshots.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> If you are using the JTDS JDBC driver, then you will need to add "ssl=require" to the URL of the connection string and you need to set the following option for the JVM "-Djsse.enableCBCProtection=false". This JVM option disables a fix for a security vulnerability, so make sure you understand what risk is involved before setting this option.
