# Understand your bill for Microsoft Azure
The charges for Microsoft Azure subscriptions vary by rate plan. Some rate plans, such as the Visual Studio Enterprise (MPN) subscribers, include monthly credits that you can use on any Azure service based on your needs.

Please note that up to 24 hours of latent usage from your prior billing period can be reported in your current billing period.

For more information about consumption and rate plans, see the [Microsoft Azure Purchase Options page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/).

<!-- The below links cover a complete list of all Microsoft Azure services.

## Understand detailed usage charges
As part of our ongoing commitment to help customers easily manage their Azure use, we've enhanced the download usage file that reports on your Azure services usage and costs.  The download link contains two versions of the usage file: **Version 1** uses the pre-existing format; **Version 2** includes additional information and updated column names in the Daily Usage section.  

Usage charges are total **monthly** charges on a subscription less any credit or discount. You are billed in arrears for your past month’s usage.  The top section of the file display the details on the services you are being billed for during the previous month's billing cycle.  The table below lists the names of the columns for each of the .csv version files.

## Analyze daily usage data
Depending on your usage, there can be thousands of rows of daily usage data. If you want to analyze this data, click **Download Usage** and choose a comma-separated variable file (.csv) version to see your daily usage data for the appropriate billing period.  For your reference, you can download a sample .csv file for each version below.

| NAME | DOWNLOAD |
|:---:|:---:|
|   Detailed Usage .csv Version 1 |[Sample File](https://azurepricing.blob.core.windows.net/sampleinvoices/Micorosft_Azure_Detailed_Usage_v1.csv) |
|   Detailed Usage .csv Version 2 |[Sample File](https://azurepricing.blob.core.windows.net/sampleinvoices/Micorosft_Azure_Detailed_Usage_v2.csv) |

![csv2screenshot](./media/billing-understand-your-bill/csv2screenshot.png)

In the .csv file, the items are broken down to display a list of how much of each resource was consumed within the current billing period.

![csv snapshot](./media/billing-understand-your-bill/csvsnapshotportal.png)

| Service Info 2 |Service Info 2 |This is a legacy field that captures optional service specific metadata. |

In addition to some new fields and name changes to csv Version 2, there will be standardized formatting for the data in the below fields:

* **Instance ID**: The Instance ID field represents the user specified identifier for the service provisioned. Currently, there are two formats in which the Instance ID is represented: it is either the name of the Resource or the fully qualified Resource ID. Microsoft Azure services are transitioning to represent the Instance ID in a standardized fully qualified Resource ID format ***(/subscriptions/<subscription id>/resourcegroups/<resourcegroupname>/providers/<providername>/<resourcename>)***. As services transition to the new format you will see the Instance ID data field change from just the resource name to Resource ID. The Resource ID is the format used by the [Azure Resource Manager API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn790567.aspx) to identify resources in an a subscription.

![instanceid](./media/billing-understand-your-bill/instanceid.png)

* **Additional Info**: The Additional Info column in the usage .csv specifies service specific metadata. For example, an image type for a VM. Currently, a service emits service specific metadata in multiple columns: Additional Info, Service Info1, and Service Info 2 fields. Microsoft Azure services will be standardizing emitting service specific metadata in the Additional Info column only.  See the below snapshot of the standardized format:

![additionalinfo_csv2](./media/billing-understand-your-bill/AdditionaInfo_csv2.png)

* **Tags**:  This column contains the user specified resource tags. The tags can be used to group billing records. For example, you can use tags to distribute costs by department using the service. Learn more about [using tags to organize Azure Resources](resource-group-using-tags.md). Services that support emitting tags are:  
  * Virtual Machines
  * Storage and
  * Networking services provisioned using the [Azure Resource Manager API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn790567.aspx)
