# Azure Stack POC first tasks
The primary objects in Azure Stack – [plans, offers, and subscriptions](azure-stack-key-features.md#services-plans-offers-and-subscriptions) – provide IaaS services, like  virtual machines and web sites, to tenants. It's these services that provide value to your tenants.

Now that you've [deployed](azure-stack-deploy.md) and [logged in](azure-stack-connect-azure-stack.md) to Azure Stack POC, here are the next steps.

First, [sign in as a service administrator](azure-stack-connect-azure-stack.md#log-in-as-a-service-administrator) and:

1. [Create a plan](azure-stack-create-plan.md) to provide compute, network, and storage services.
2. [Create an offer](azure-stack-create-offer.md) that will contain the plan.

Then, [sign in as a tenant](azure-stack-connect-azure-stack.md#log-in-as-a-tenant) and:

1. [Subscribe to the offer](azure-stack-subscribe-plan-provision-vm.md) and get access to the offer’s plans.
2. [Use the services](azure-stack-provision-vm.md) provided by the offer’s plan to create a virtual machine.
