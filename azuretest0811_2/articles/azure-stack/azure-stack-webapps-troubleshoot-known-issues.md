# Web Apps Resource Provider - Known Issues and Troubleshooting
If you experience issues while deploying or working with Web Apps on Azure Stack please refer to the guidance below.

## Azure Stack Web Apps Not Available in the portal

After you have completed the [registration of the Azure Stack Web Apps Provider](azure-stack-webapps-deploy.md#register-the-newly-deployed-azure-stack-web-apps-provider-with-arm) if you cannot find the Web + Mobile blade then please try the following:

* **Logout of the portal** and **close your browser** and then in a **new browser window login to the portal** and try again.

If you still cannot see the web and mobile blade please try the following:

1. On the **Azure Stack Host Machine** in **Hyper-V Manager** locate the **xRPVM** and **connect** to the VM.
2. Open an **command prompt as Administrator** and run **IISRESET**
3. Return to the **ClientVM** and open a **new browser window**, **login to the portal** and try again.

## Deployment Fails when Creating a Web App in a New Resource Group
In the first Preview of Web Apps, **all Web Apps** must be created in the same Resource Group as the Web Apps Resource Provider (**AppService-LOCAL**).  This is a known issue and will be resolved in a future preview.

## Other Issues
If you encounter other issues with Web Apps on Azure Stack please post in [the Azure Stack Forum](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/azure/home?forum=azurestack) where members of our team are monitoring posts.
