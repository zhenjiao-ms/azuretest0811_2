# Add a MySQL resource provider to Azure Stack
MySQL databases support common website platforms as is a common technology used on the websites scene. You can deploy the MySQL Resource Provider to work with servers and databases through Azure Resource Manager deployment templates, as well as deploy WordPress websites from the Azure Web Apps add on for Azure Stack.

## Prepare the Azure Stack POC machine
Before deploying MySQL resource providers, turn off IE Enhanced Security, install the latest version of Azure PowerShell, and prepare the Azure Stack POC environment with the necessary certifications, marketplace items, and binaries.

1. On the Azure Stack POC machine, download the [AzureStackMySQLforWebApps.zip](http://aka.ms/MASMySQLRP) file and extract the contents to D:\MySql.
2. Run the **D:\Mysql\Bootstrap.cmd** file as an administrator (use the portal service admin account). This opens the Bootstrap.ps1 file in PowerShell ISE.
3. Click the **Prepare MySql Prerequisites** tab.
4. Click the **New-SslCert.ps1** tab and run it. In the prompt, type the PFX password that is used to protect the private key. This command adds the \_.AzureStack.local.pfx SSL certificate to the D:\MySql\Prerequisites\BlobStorage\Container folder. This certificate secures communication between the resource provider and the local instance of the Azure Resource Manager.
5. Click the **Download-MySqlServer.ps1** tab and run it. When prompted, accept the EULA by clicking **Yes** in the **Confirm** dialog box. This command adds two zip files to the D:\MySql\Prerequisites\BlobStorage\Container folder.
6. Click the **Upload-Microsoft.MySql-RP.ps1** tab and run it. In the **Windows PowerShell credential request** dialog box, type the Azure Stack service administrator credentials. This command uploads the binaries for the MySQL resource provider.
   
   > When prompted for AadTenantID, input your AAD tenant name, e.g. microsoftazurestack.onmicrosoft.com
   > When Prompted for service admin credentials, input your Azure Stack Service Admin user's username and password
   > 
   > 
7. Click the **Publish-GalleryPackages.ps1** tab and run it. In the **Windows PowerShell credential request** dialog box, type the Azure Stack service administrator credentials. This command adds two marketplace items to the Azure Stack POC portal.
8. Verify that these files are in the D:\MySql\Prerequisites\BlobStorage\Container folder:
   
   * AzureStack.MySql.Setup.1.0.46.0.nupkg
   * mysql-5.5.44-winx64.zip
   * mysql-5.6.26-winx64.zip
   * \_.AzureStack.local.pfx

## Deploy the MySQL resource provider VM
Now that you have prepared the Azure Stack POC with the necessary certificates and marketplace items, you can deploy a MySQL resource provider.

1. Log in to the Azure Stack portal as a service administrator.
2. Click **New**, click **Marketplace**, click **Resource Providers**, and then click **MySQL Resource Provider**.
3. In the **MySql Resource Provider** blade, click **Create**.
4. In the **Parameters** blade, accept the default values for the parameters and type usernames and passwords for the other parameters.
5. Click **OK**.
6. Under **Resource group**, click **Or create new**, and in the text box type *MySQL01*.
7. Click **Create**. Deployment of the resource provider will take 20-30 minutes.
8. To find your resource provider, click **Browse**, click **Resource Providers**, and look for **mysql1** in the list.

## Update DNS and register the MySQL resource provider
1. To make your newly deployed machine discoverable to other machines in your Azure Stack deployment run the **Add-DNSEntry.PS1** script.
2. In PowerShell ISE, click the **Deploy MySql provider** tab, click the **Register-Microsoft.MySql-fqdn.ps1** tab, and run it. When prompted for the Zero-day credentials, type your service admin credentials.
3. Click the **Register-Microsoft.MySql-provider.ps1** tab and run it. When prompted for the Zero-day credentials, type your service admin credentials.
