# Use audit logs to send email and webhook alert notifications in Azure Insights
This article shows you the payload schema when an audit log event triggers a webhook and it describes how you can send emails using the same event.

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is currently in Preview. Over the coming months the Alert on Events infrastructure and performance will be improved. In this preview, this feature is only accessible using Azure PowerShell and CLI. Access to the same feature using the Azure portal will be available later.

## Webhooks
Webhooks allow you to route Azure alert notifications to other systems for post-processing or custom notifications. For example, routing the alert to services that can handle an incoming web request to send SMS, log bugs, or notify someone using chat or messaging services. The webhook URI must be a valid HTTP or HTTPS endpoint.

## Email
Emails can be sent to any valid email address. Administrators and co-administrators of the subscription where the rule is running will also be notified.

### Example email rule
You must set up an email rule, a webhook rule and then tell the rules to start when the audit log event occurs. You can see an example using PowerShell at [Azure Insights PowerShell quickstart samples](insights-powershell-samples.md#alert-on-audit-log-event).

## Authentication
There are two authentication URI forms:

1. Token-based authentication by saving the webhook URI with a token Id as a query parameter. For example, https://mysamplealert/webcallback?tokenid=sometokenid&someparameter=somevalue
2. Basic authentication by using a user ID and password. For example, https://userid:password@mysamplealert/webcallback?someparamater=somevalue&parameter=value

## Audit log event notification webhook payload schema
When a new event becomes available, the alert on audit log events executes the configured webhook with event metadata in the webhook payload. The following example shows the webhook payload schema:

```
