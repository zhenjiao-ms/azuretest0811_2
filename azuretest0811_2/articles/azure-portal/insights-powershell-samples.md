# Azure Insights PowerShell quick start samples
This article shows you sample PowerShell commands to help you quickly access Azure Insights monitoring features. Azure Insights allows you to AutoScale Cloud Services, Virtual Machines, and Web Apps and to send alert notifications or call web URLs based on values of configured telemetry data.  

## Set up PowerShell
If you haven't already, set up PowerShell to run on your computer. For more information, see [How to Install and Configure PowerShell](../powershell-install-configure.md) .

## Examples in this article
The examples in the article illustrate how you can use Azure Insights cmdlets. You can also review the entire list of Azure Insights (monitoring) cmdlets at [Azure Insights Cmdlets](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt282452.aspx).

## Sign in and use subscriptions
First, log into your Azure subscription.

```
Login-AzureRmAccount
```

This requires you to sign in. Once you do, your Account, TenantId and default Subscription Id are displayed. All the Azure cmdlets work in the context of your default subscription. To view the list of subscriptions you have access to, use the following command.

```
Get-AzureRmSubscription
```

To change your working context to a different subscription, use the following command.

```
Set-AzureRmContext -SubscriptionId <subscriptionid>
```


## Retrieve Audit logs for a subscription
Use the `Get-AzureRmLog` cmdlet.  Below are some common examples.

Get log entries from this time/date to present:

```
Get-AzureRmLog -StartTime 2016-03-01T10:30
```

Get log entries between a time/date range:

```
Get-AzureRmLog -StartTime 2015-01-01T10:30 -EndTime 2015-01-01T11:30
```

Get log entries from a specific resource group:

```
Get-AzureRmLog -ResourceGroup 'myrg1'
```

Get log entries from a specific resource provider between a time/date range:

```
Get-AzureRmLog -ResourceProvider 'Microsoft.Web' -StartTime 2015-01-01T10:30 -EndTime 2015-01-01T11:30
```

Get all log entries with a specific caller:

```
Get-AzureRmLog -Caller 'myname@company.com'
```

The following command retrieves the last 1000 events from the audit log:

```
Get-AzureRmLog -MaxEvents 1000
```

`Get-AzureRmLog` supports many other parameters. See the `Get-AzureRmLog` reference for more information.

> [!NOTE]
> `Get-AzureRmLog` only provides 15 days of history. Using the **-MaxEvents** parameter allows you to query the last N events, beyond 15 days. To access events older than 15 days, use the REST API or SDK (C# sample using the SDK). If you do not include **StartTime**, then the default value is **EndTime** minus one hour. If you do not include **EndTime**, then the default value is current time. All times are in UTC.

## Retrieve alerts history
To view all alert events, you can query the Azure Resource Manager (ARM) logs using the following examples.

```
Get-AzureRmLog -Caller "Microsoft.Insights/alertRules" -DetailedOutput -StartTime 2015-03-01
```

To view the history for a specific alert rule, you can use the `Get-AzureRmAlertHistory` cmdlet, passing in the resource ID of the alert rule.

```
Get-AzureRmAlertHistory -ResourceId /subscriptions/s1/resourceGroups/rg1/providers/microsoft.insights/alertrules/myalert -StartTime 2016-03-1 -Status Activated
```

The `Get-AzureRmAlertHistory` cmdlet supports various parameters. More information, see [Get-AlertHistory](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt282453.aspx).

## Retrieve information on alert rules
All of the following commands act on a Resource Group named "montest".

View all the properties of the alert rule:

```
Get-AzureRmAlertRule -Name simpletestCPU -ResourceGroup montest -DetailedOutput
```

Retrieve all alerts on a resource group:

```
Get-AzureRmAlertRule -ResourceGroup montest
```

Retrieve all alert rules set for a target resource. For example, all alert rules set on a VM.

```
Get-AzureRmAlertRule -ResourceGroup montest -TargetResourceId /subscriptions/s1/resourceGroups/montest/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/testconfig
```

`Get-AzureRmAlertRule` supports other parameters. See [Get-AlertRule](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt282459.aspx) for more information.

## Create alert rules
You can use the `Add-AlertRule` cmdlet to create, update or disable an alert rule.

You can create email and webhook properties using  `New-AzureRmAlertRuleEmail` and `New-AzureRmAlertRuleWebhook`, respectively. In the Alert rule cmdlet, assign these as actions to the **Actions** property of the Alert Rule.

The next section contains a sample that shows you how to create an Alert Rule with various parameters.

### Alert rule on a metric
The following table describes the parameters and values used to create an alert using a metric.

| parameter | value |
| --- | --- |
| Name |simpletestdiskwrite |
| Location of this alert rule |East US |
| ResourceGroup |montest |
| TargetResourceId |/subscriptions/s1/resourceGroups/montest/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/testconfig |
| MetricName of the alert that is created |\PhysicalDisk(_Total)\Disk Writes/sec. See the `Get-MetricDefinitions` cmdlet below about how to retrieve the exact metric names |
| operator |GreaterThan |
| Threshold value (count/sec in for this metric) |1 |
| WindowSize (hh:mm:ss format) |00:05:00 |
| aggregator (statistic of the metric, which uses Average count, in this case) |Average |
| custom emails (string array) |'foo@example.com','bar@example.com' |
| send email to owners, contributors and readers |-SendToServiceOwners |

Create an Email action

```
$actionEmail = New-AzureRmAlertRuleEmail -CustomEmail myname@company.com
```

Create a Webhook action

```
$actionWebhook = New-AzureRmAlertRuleWebhook -ServiceUri https://example.com?token=mytoken
```

Create the alert rule on the CPU% metric on a classic VM

```
Add-AzureRmMetricAlertRule -Name vmcpu_gt_1 -Location "East US" -ResourceGroup myrg1 -TargetResourceId /subscriptions/s1/resourceGroups/myrg1/providers/Microsoft.ClassicCompute/virtualMachines/my_vm1 -MetricName "Percentage CPU" -Operator GreaterThan -Threshold 1 -WindowSize 00:05:00 -TimeAggregationOperator Average -Actions $actionEmail, $actionWebhook -Description "alert on CPU > 1%"
```

Retrieve the alert rule

```
Get-AzureRmAlertRule -Name vmcpu_gt_1 -ResourceGroup myrg1 -DetailedOutput
```

The Add alert cmdlet also updates the rule if an alert rule already exists for the given properties. To disable an alert rule, include the parameter **-DisableRule**.

### Alert on audit log event
> [!NOTE]
> This feature is still in Preview.
> 
> 

In this scenario, you'll send email when a website is successfully started in my subscription in resource group *abhingrgtest123*.

Setup an email rule

```
$actionEmail = New-AzureRmAlertRuleEmail -CustomEmail myname@company.com
```

Setup a webhook rule

```
$actionWebhook = New-AzureRmAlertRuleWebhook -ServiceUri https://example.com?token=mytoken
```

Create the rule on the event

```
Add-AzureRmLogAlertRule -Name superalert1 -Location "East US" -ResourceGroup myrg1 -OperationName microsoft.web/sites/start/action -Status Succeeded -TargetResourceGroup abhingrgtest123 -Actions $actionEmail, $actionWebhook
```

Retrieve the alert rule

```
Get-AzureRmAlertRule -Name superalert1 -ResourceGroup myrg1 -DetailedOutput
```

The `Add-AlertRule` cmdlet allows various other parameters. More information, see [Add-AlertRule](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt282468.aspx).

## Get a list of available metrics for alerts
You can use the `Get-AzureRmMetricDefinition` cmdlet to view the list of all metrics for a specific resource.

```
Get-AzureRmMetricDefinition -ResourceId <resource_id>
```

The following example generates a table with the metric Name and the Unit for it.

```
Get-AzureRmMetricDefinition -ResourceId <resource_id> | Format-Table -Property Name,Unit
```

A full list of available options for `Get-AzureRmMetricDefinition` is available at [Get-MetricDefinitions](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt282458.aspx).

## Create and manage AutoScale settings
A resource, such as a Web app, VM, Cloud Service or VM Scale Set can have only one autoscale setting configured for it.
However, each autoscale setting can have multiple profiles. For example, one for a performance-based scale profile and a second one for a schedule based profile. Each profile can have multiple rules configured on it. For more information about Autoscale, see [How to Autoscale an Application](../cloud-services/cloud-services-how-to-scale.md).

Here are the steps we will use:

1. Create rule(s).
2. Create profile(s) mapping the rules that you created previously to the profiles.
3. Optional: Create notifications for autoscale by configuring webhook and email properties.
4. Create an autoscale setting with a name on the target resource by mapping the profiles and notifications that you created in the previous steps.

The following examples show you how you can create an Autoscale setting for a VM scale set for a Windows operating system based by using the CPU utilization metric.

First, create a rule to scale-out, with an instance count increase .

```
$rule1 = New-AzureRmAutoscaleRule -MetricName "\Processor(_Total)\% Processor Time" -MetricResourceId /subscriptions/s1/resourceGroups/big2/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets/big2 -Operator GreaterThan -MetricStatistic Average -Threshold 0.01 -TimeGrain 00:01:00 -TimeWindow 00:10:00 -ScaleActionCooldown 00:10:00 -ScaleActionDirection Increase -ScaleActionScaleType ChangeCount -ScaleActionValue 1
```        

Next, create a rule to scale-in, with an instance count decrease.

```
$rule2 = New-AzureRmAutoscaleRule -MetricName "\Processor(_Total)\% Processor Time" -MetricResourceId /subscriptions/s1/resourceGroups/big2/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets/big2 -Operator GreaterThan -MetricStatistic Average -Threshold 2 -TimeGrain 00:01:00 -TimeWindow 00:10:00 -ScaleActionCooldown 00:10:00 -ScaleActionDirection Decrease -ScaleActionScaleType ChangeCount -ScaleActionValue 1
```

Then, create a profile for the rules.

```
$profile1 = New-AzureRmAutoscaleProfile -DefaultCapacity 2 -MaximumCapacity 10 -MinimumCapacity 2 -Rules $rule1,$rule2 -Name "My_Profile"
```

Create a webhook property.

```
$webhook_scale = New-AzureRmAutoscaleWebhook -ServiceUri "https://example.com?mytoken=mytokenvalue"
```

Create the notification property for the autoscale setting, including email and the webhook that you created previously.

```
$notification1= New-AzureRmAutoscaleNotification -CustomEmails ashwink@microsoft.com -SendEmailToSubscriptionAdministrators SendEmailToSubscriptionCoAdministrators -Webhooks $webhook_scale
```

Finally, create the autoscale setting to add the profile that you created above.

```
Add-AzureRmAutoscaleSetting -Location "East US" -Name "MyScaleVMSSSetting" -ResourceGroup big2 -TargetResourceId /subscriptions/s1/resourceGroups/big2/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets/big2 -AutoscaleProfiles $profile1 -Notifications $notification1
```

For more information about managing Autoscale settings, see [Get-AutoscaleSetting](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt282461.aspx).

## Autoscale history
The following example shows you how you can view recent autoscale and alert events. Use the audit log search to view the Autoscale history.

```
Get-AzureRmLog -Caller "Microsoft.Insights/autoscaleSettings" -DetailedOutput -StartTime 2015-03-01
```

You can use the `Get-AzureRmAutoScaleHistory` cmdlet to retrieve AutoScale history.

```
Get-AzureRmAutoScaleHistory -ResourceId /subscriptions/s1/resourceGroups/myrg1/providers/microsoft.insights/autoscalesettings/myScaleSetting -StartTime 2016-03-15 -DetailedOutput
```

For more information, see [Get-AutoscaleHistory](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt282464.aspx).

### View details for an autoscale setting
You can use the `Get-Autoscalesetting` cmdlet to retrieve more information about the autoscale setting.

The following example shows details about all autoscale settings in the resource group 'myrg1'.

```
Get-AzureRmAutoscalesetting -ResourceGroup myrg1 -DetailedOutput
```

The following example shows details about all autoscale settings in the resource group 'myrg1' and specifically the autoscale setting named 'MyScaleVMSSSetting'.

```
Get-AzureRmAutoscalesetting -ResourceGroup myrg1 -Name MyScaleVMSSSetting -DetailedOutput
```

### Remove an autoscale setting
You can use the `Remove-Autoscalesetting` cmdlet to delete an autoscale setting.

```
Remove-AzureRmAutoscalesetting -ResourceGroup myrg1 -Name MyScaleVMSSSetting
```

## Manage log profiles for audit logs
You can create a *log profile* and export data from your audit logs to a storage account and you can configure data retention for it. Optionally, you can also stream the data to your Event Hub. Note that this feature is currently in Preview and you can only create one log profile per subscription. You can use the following cmdlets with your current subscription to create and manage log profiles. You can also choose a particular subscription. Although PowerShell defaults to the current subscription, you can always change that using `Set-AzureRmContext`. You can configure audit logs to route data to any storage account or Event Hub within that subscription. Data is written as blob files in JSON format.

### Get a log profile
To fetch your existing log profiles, use the `Get-AzureRmLogProfile` cmdlet.

### Add a log profile without data retention
```
Add-AzureRmLogProfile -Name my_log_profile_s1 -StorageAccountId /subscriptions/s1/resourceGroups/myrg1/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/my_storage -Locations global,westus,eastus,northeurope,westeurope,eastasia,southeastasia,japaneast,japanwest,northcentralus,southcentralus,eastus2,centralus,australiaeast,australiasoutheast,brazilsouth,centralindia,southindia,westindia
```

### Remove a log profile
```
Remove-AzureRmLogProfile -name my_log_profile_s1
```

### Add a log profile with data retention
You can specify the **-RetentionInDays** property with the number of days, as a positive integer, where the data is retained.

```
Add-AzureRmLogProfile -Name my_log_profile_s1 -StorageAccountId /subscriptions/s1/resourceGroups/myrg1/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/my_storage -Locations global,westus,eastus,northeurope,westeurope,eastasia,southeastasia,japaneast,japanwest,northcentralus,southcentralus,eastus2,centralus,australiaeast,australiasoutheast,brazilsouth,centralindia,southindia,westindia -RetentionInDays 90
```

### Add log profile with retention and EventHub
In addition to routing your data to storage account, you can also stream it to an Event Hub. Note that in this preview release and the storage account configuration is mandatory but Event Hub configuration is optional.

```
Add-AzureRmLogProfile -Name my_log_profile_s1 -StorageAccountId /subscriptions/s1/resourceGroups/myrg1/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/my_storage -serviceBusRuleId /subscriptions/s1/resourceGroups/Default-ServiceBus-EastUS/providers/Microsoft.ServiceBus/namespaces/mytestSB/authorizationrules/RootManageSharedAccessKey -Locations global,westus,eastus,northeurope,westeurope,eastasia,southeastasia,japaneast,japanwest,northcentralus,southcentralus,eastus2,centralus,australiaeast,australiasoutheast,brazilsouth,centralindia,southindia,westindia -RetentionInDays 90
```

## Configure diagnostics logs
Many Azure services provide additional logs and telemetry, including Azure Network Security Groups, Software Load Balancers, Key Vault, Azure Search Services, and Logic Apps and they can be configured to save data in your Azure Storage account. That operation can only be performed at a resource level and the storage account should be present in the same region as the target resource where the diagnostics setting is configured.

### Get diagnostic setting
```
Get-AzureRmDiagnosticSetting -ResourceId /subscriptions/s1/resourceGroups/myrg1/providers/Microsoft.Logic/workflows/andy0315logicapp
```

Disable diagnostic setting

```
Set-AzureRmDiagnosticSetting -ResourceId /subscriptions/s1/resourceGroups/myrg1/providers/Microsoft.Logic/workflows/andy0315logicapp -StorageAccountId /subscriptions/s1/resourceGroups/Default-Storage-WestUS/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/mystorageaccount -Enable $false
```

Enable diagnostic setting without retention

```
Set-AzureRmDiagnosticSetting -ResourceId /subscriptions/s1/resourceGroups/myrg1/providers/Microsoft.Logic/workflows/andy0315logicapp -StorageAccountId /subscriptions/s1/resourceGroups/Default-Storage-WestUS/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/mystorageaccount -Enable $true
```

Enable diagnostic setting with retention

```
Set-AzureRmDiagnosticSetting -ResourceId /subscriptions/s1/resourceGroups/myrg1/providers/Microsoft.Logic/workflows/andy0315logicapp -StorageAccountId /subscriptions/s1/resourceGroups/Default-Storage-WestUS/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/mystorageaccount -Enable $true -RetentionEnabled $true -RetentionInDays 90
```

Enable diagnostic setting with retention for a specific log category

```
Set-AzureRmDiagnosticSetting -ResourceId /subscriptions/s1/resourceGroups/insights-integration/providers/Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/viruela1 -StorageAccountId /subscriptions/s1/resourceGroups/myrg1/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/sakteststorage -Categories NetworkSecurityGroupEvent -Enable $true -RetentionEnabled $true -RetentionInDays 90
```
