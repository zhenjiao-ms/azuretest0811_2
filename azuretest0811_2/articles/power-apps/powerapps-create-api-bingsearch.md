Add the Bing Search API to your organization's (tenant) app service environment. 

## Create the API in the Azure portal

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), sign-in with your work account. For example, sign-in with *yourUserName*@*YourCompany*.com. When you do this, you are automatically signed in to your company subscription.

2. Select **Browse** in the task bar:  
![][4]

3. In the list, you can scroll to find PowerApps or type in *powerapps*:  
![][5]  

4. In **PowerApps**, select **Manage APIs**:  
![Browse to registered apis][2]

2. In **Manage APIs**, select **Add** to add the new API:  
![Add API][3]

3. Enter a descriptive **name** for your API. 

4. In **Source**, select **Available API** to select the pre-built APIs, and select **Bing Search**:  

    1. Select **Settings - Configure required settings**.
    2. Enter *Account Key*. If you don't have a Bing Search Key, create a free [Bing Search offer][1] to get a key.
    3. Select **OK**. 

5. Select **OK** to complete the steps. 

When finished, a new Bing Search API is added to your app service environment.
