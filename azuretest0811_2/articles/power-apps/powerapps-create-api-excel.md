Add the Excel API to your organization's (tenant) app service environment. 

## Create the API in the Azure portal

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), sign-in with your work account. For example, sign-in with *yourUserName*@*YourCompany*.com. When you do this, you are automatically signed in to your company subscription.

2. Select **Browse** in the task bar:  
![][4]

3. In the list, you can scroll to find PowerApps or type in *powerapps*:  
![][5]  

4. In **PowerApps**, select **Manage APIs**:  
![Browse to registered apis][1]

5. In **Mange APIs**, select **Add** to add the new API:  
![Add API][2]

6. Enter a descriptive **name** for your API.  

7. In **Source**, select **Available APIs** to select the pre-built APIs, and then select **Excel**:  
![select Excel api][3]

8. Select **OK** to complete these steps.

When finished, a new Excel API is added to your app service environment.

## Summary and next steps
In this topic, you added the Excel API to your PowersApps Enterprise. Next, give users access to the API so it can be added to their apps:
