Add the SharePoint Online API to your organization's (tenant) app service environment. 

## Create the API in the Azure portal

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), sign-in with your work account. For example, sign-in with *yourUserName*@*YourCompany*.com. When you do this, you are automatically signed in to your company subscription.

2. Select **Browse** in the task bar:  
![][14]

3. In the list, you can scroll to find PowerApps or type in *powerapps*:  
![][15]  

4. In **PowerApps**, select **Manage APIs**:  
![Browse to registered apis][1]

5. In **Manage APIs**, select **Add** to add the new API:  
![Add API][2]

6. Enter a descriptive **name** for your API.  

7. In **Source**, select **Available APIs** to select the pre-built APIs, and select **SharePoint Online**:  
![select SharePoint Online api][3]

8. Select **Settings - Configure required settings**:  
![configure SharePoint Online API settings][4]

9. Enter the *Client Id* and *App Secret* of your SharePoint Online Azure Active Directory (AAD) application. If you don't have one, see the "Register an AAD app for use with PowerApps" section in this topic to create the ID and secret values you need.  

    > [AZURE.IMPORTANT] Save the **redirect URL**. You may need this value later in this topic.

10. Select **OK** to complete the steps.

When finished, a new SharePoint Online API is added to your app service environment.


## Register an AAD app for use with PowerApps SharePoint Online API

1. Open the [Azure Portal][5].

2. Select **Browse** and then select **Active Directory**:  

    > [AZURE.NOTE] This opens Active Directory in the Azure classic portal.  

3. Select your organization's tenant name:  
![Launch Azure Active Directory][6]

4. Select the **Applications** tab, and select **Add**:  
![AAD tenant applications][7]

5. In **Add application**:  

    a) Enter a **Name** for your application.  
    b) Leave the application type as **Web**.  
    c) Select **Next**.


    ![Add AAD application - app info][8]

6. In **App Properties**:  

    a) Enter the **SIGN-ON URL** of your application.  Since you are going to authenticate with AAD for PowerApps, set the sign-on url to _https://login.windows.net_.  
    b) Enter a valid **APP ID URI** for your app.  
    c) Select **OK**.  

    ![Add AAD application - app properties][9]

7. On successful completion, you are redirected to the new AAD app. Select **Configure**:  
![Contoso AAD app][10]

8. Set the **Reply URL** under _OAuth 2_ section to the redirect URL you received when you added the new SharePont Online API in the Azure Portal (in this topic). Select **Add application**:  
![Configure Contoso AAD app][11]

9. In the **Permissions to other applications** window, select **Office 365 Exchange Online**, and select **OK**:  
![Contoso app delegate][12]

10. Back in the configure page, note that _Office 365 Exchange Online_ is added to the _Permission to other applications_ list.

11. Select **Delegated Permissions** for _Office 365 Exchange Online_, and select the following permissions:  

    - Read and write items in all site collections
    - Read and write items and lists in all site collections

    ![Contoso app delegate permissions][13]

A new Azure Active Directory app is created. You can use this app in your SharePoint Online API configuration in the Azure portal. 

## Summary and next steps
In this topic, you added the SharePoint Online API to your PowersApps Enterprise. Next, give users access to the API so it can be added to their apps:
