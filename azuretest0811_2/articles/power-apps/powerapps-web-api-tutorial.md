# Tutorial: Create a custom AAD protected web API for PowerApps and Logic Flows
This tutorial shows you how to create a ASP.Net web API, host it on Azure Webapps, enable AAD authentication (via easy auth), and then register the web API in PowerApps and Logic flows. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This topic has moved to powerapps.microsoft.com at [Tutorial: Create a custom AAD protected Web API for PowerApps and Flow](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/tutorials/customapi-web-api-tutorial/). Please go to PowerApps for the latest version. This Azure link is being archived.

## What you need to get started
* An Azure subscription
* A PowerApps account
* Visual Studio 2013 or higher

## Step 1: Create a WebAPI and deploy it on Azure
1. Open Visual Studio and create a new C# ASP.NET web application:  
   ![](./media/powerapps-web-api-tutorial/newwebapp.png "New WebApp")
2. On the next screen, select the web API template, and select **No Authentication**:  
   ![](./media/powerapps-web-api-tutorial/noauth.png "No Authorization")
   
   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Make sure you set authentication to "No Authentication".
   > 
3. When the project is created, you need to build the web API for your resources. For this tutorial, we do not go in to the specifics of building a web API.
4. Next, Generate a Swagger file for the web API. You can do this easily by opening the **Package Manager Console**, and installing **Swashbuckle**:  
   ![](./media/powerapps-web-api-tutorial/swashbuckle-console.png "Swashbuckle console")
5. Once installed and enabled, browse the following Swagger docs and UI endpoints respectively:  
   **\<your-root-url\>/swagger/docs/v1**  
   
     **\<your-root-url\>/swagger**  
6. Once you are comfortable with your web API, publish it to Azure. To publish in Visual Studio, go to **BUILD**, and select **PUBLISH** .
7. Extract the swagger json by navigating to ***https://\<azure-webapp-url\>/swagger/docs/v1***.  
   
   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > A swagger document with duplicate operationid(s) is invalid. If you are using the sample C# template, the operation-id "Values_Get" is repeated twice. Change one instance to "Value_Get".
   > 
   > 
   > 

You can download the swagger used in this tutorial [here](http://pwrappssamples.blob.core.windows.net/samples/webAPI.json). Be sure to replace/remove the comments before using it. Comments start with `//`.

## Step 2: Set up AAD authentication
This tutorial assumes you know how to create an AAD application in Azure. To learn more about how to create an AAD application, read the [Azure resource manager tutorial](powerapps-azure-resource-manager-tutorial.md). We need two AAD applications for this tutorial. 

1. The first AAD application is used to secure the web API. Name it **webAPI**.
2. The second AAD application is used to secure the custom API registration and acquire delegated access to the web API protected by the first app. Name this one **webAPI-customAPI** .
3. For **webAPI**, use the following configuration:  
   
   1. Sign-on url: ***https://login.windows.net***
   2. App-ID Uri: ***https://\<your-root-url\>*** (typically the url of your website deployed on Azure)
   3. Reply url: ***https://\<your-root-url\>/.auth/login/aad/callback***  
      
      > [!IMPORTANT]
      > You need the Client ID of this app later, so note it.
      > 
4. For **webAPI-customAPI**, use the following configuration:  
   
   1. Sign-on url: **https://login.windows.net**
   2. App-ID Uri: ***can be any unique URL***
   3. Reply url: ***https://msmanaged-na.consent.azure-apim.net/redirect***
   4. Add permissions to have delegated access to webAPI.
   5. You need the Client ID of this app later as well, so note it.
   6. Generate a key and store is somewhere safe. We need this key later.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Both apps must be in the same directory.
> 
> 

## Step 3: Set up easy auth on your web app
1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and go to your web app that you deployed in **Step 1** (in this topic).
2. In **Settings**, select **"Authentication / Authorization"**.
3. Turn on **App Service Authentication**, and select **Azure Active Directory**.  On the next blade, select **Express**.  
4. Click on the **Select Existing AD App**, and select the first AAD application you created as part of Step two. In this case, select **webAPI**.

This should setup AAD authentication for you web app.

## Step 4: Set up the Custom API
1. We need to modify our swagger a bit to enter the `securityDefintions` object and AAD authentication used for the web app. Add the following lines of code: 
   
    ```javascript
   "host": "<your-root-url>",
   "schemes": [
    "https"                        //Change scheme to https 
   ],
   "securityDefinitions": {
    "AAD": {
      "type": "oauth2",
      "flow": "implicit",
      "authorizationUrl": "https://login.windows.net/common/oauth2/authorize",
      "scopes": []
    }
   },
    ```
2. Go to the PowerApps [web portal](https://web.powerapps.com), and add a custom API.  [Use Custom APIs in Logic Flows and PowerApps](powerapps-register-custom-api.md) lists the steps.
3. Once you have uploaded your Swagger, the wizard auto-detects that you are using AAD authentication for your webAPI.
4. Configure the AAD authentication for your custom API:  
   
   1. Client ID: ***Client ID of webAPI-CustomAPI*** from 4.5 in **Step 2** (in this topic)
   2. Secret: ***Key from webPI-CustomAPI*** from 4.6 in **Step 2** (in this topic)
   3. Login url: ***https://login.windows.net***
   4. ResourceUri: ***Client ID of webAPI*** from 3.4 in **Step 2** (in this topic)
5. Select **Create**, and try creating a connection on the Custom API. If everything is setup correctly, you should be able to sign-in successfully.
