# Get insights from Azure Security Center data with Power BI
The [Power BI Dashboard](http://aka.ms/azure-security-center-power-bi) for Azure Security Center enables you to visualize, analyze, and filter recommendations and security alerts from anywhere, including your mobile device. Use the Power BI dashboard to reveal trends and attack patterns - view security alerts by resource or source IP address and unaddressed security risks by resource or age. You can also mash up Security Center recommendations and security alerts with other data in interesting ways, for example with [Azure Audit Logs](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/blog/monitor-azure-audit-logs-with-power-bi/) and [Azure SQL Database Auditing](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/blog/monitor-your-azure-sql-database-auditing-activity-with-power-bi/), which both offer Power BI Dashboards, or you can export this data to Excel for easy reporting on the security state of your cloud resources.

## Using Azure Security Center dashboard to access Power BI
You can also use the Azure Security Center dashboard to access Power BI reports. Follow the steps below to perform this task: 

1. In the **Azure Security Center** dashboard click **Explore in Power BI** button.
   
    ![Connect to Azure Security Center using Power BI](./media/security-center-powerbi/security-center-powerbi-fig1-new1.png) 
2. The **Explore in Power BI** blade opens on the right side as shown below:
   
    ![Connect to Azure Security Center using Power BI](./media/security-center-powerbi/security-center-powerbi-fig1-new2.png)
3. If you are creating the Power BI dashboard for the first time, you can choose one of the options below in the Explore in Power BI blade: 
   
   * **Security insights dashboard**: choose this option if you want to create a dashboard that includes security status, threads and detections. This is a more common option for DevOps role that are responsible for analyzing their protection status and detected alerts across subscriptions.
   * **Policy management dashboard**: choose this option if you want to explore management and enforcement policy.  This is a more common option for Central IT who are more focused on governance. They can use this dashboard to gain visibility and insights on security policy adherence across their organization.
   * If you already have a Power BI dashboard, click **Go to your current Power BI dashboard**.
4. For the purpose of this example, click **Security insights dashboard** option. If this is the first time you are creating a Power BI dashboard for Security Center you will be prompted to install the content pack. Click **Get** button in the **Content packs for Power BI** window as shown below:
   
    ![Azure Security Center Security Insights dashboard](./media/security-center-powerbi/security-center-powerbi-fig1-new3.png)
5. The **Connect to Azure Security Center Security Insights** window appear. Make sure the **Authentication** method is **oAuth2** as shown below and click **Sign in** button.
   
    ![Authentication](./media/security-center-powerbi/security-center-powerbi-fig1-new4.png)
6. You may be asked to authenticate again with your Azure credentials. After authenticating your dashboard will be created. Once the dashboard is created you will see a report with the similar structure as shown below:
   
    ![Power BI Dashboard](./media/security-center-powerbi/security-center-powerbi-fig1-new5.png)

> [!NOTE]
> A refresh of the report is scheduled to take place on a daily basis, if you experience a failure on this refresh, read [Potential Refresh Issues with the Azure Security Center Power BI](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/azuresecurity/2016/04/07/azure-security-center-power-bi-refresh-fails/), for more information on how to troubleshoot.

Here you can see the number of security alerts and recommendations, as well as the number of VMs, Azure SQL databases and network resources being monitored by Azure Security Center.

A link to Azure Security Center redirects you to the Azure portal. The charts make it easy to visualize information about security recommendations and alerts, including:

* Resource Security State
* Pending Recommendations
* VM Recommendations
* Alerts over Time
* Attacked Resources
* Attacked IPs

Behind each chart there are additional insights. Select a tile to see more information. For example, the **Resource Security State** tile shows you additional details about pending recommendations by resources as shown below:

![Recommendations](./media/security-center-powerbi/security-center-powerbi-fig1-new6.png)

If you click on any line of this graph, the others will gray out and you focus only on the one you selected. To return to the dashboard, click **Azure Security Center** under the **Dashboards** option on the left pane of this page.

> [!NOTE]
> If you’d like to customize your reports by adding additional fields or changing existing visuals, you can edit the report. Read [Interact with a report in Editing View in Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/documentation/powerbi-service-interact-with-a-report-in-editing-view/) for more information.

The **Alerts over Time, Attacked Resources** and **Attacker IPs** tiles will have the similar output when you click on each one of it. This happens because the report aggregates information regarding all those three variables and calls it **Resources under Attack** as shown below:

![Resources under attack](./media/security-center-powerbi/security-center-powerbi-fig1-new7.png)

At this point you can also save a copy of this report, print it or publish it on the web by using the options available in the **File** menu.
