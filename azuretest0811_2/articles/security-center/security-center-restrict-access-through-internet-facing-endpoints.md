# Restrict access through Internet-facing endpoints in Azure Security Center
Azure Security Center will recommend that you restrict access through Internet-facing endpoints if any of your Network Security Groups (NSGs) has one or more inbound rules that allow access from “any” source IP address. Opening access to “any” may enable attackers to access your resources. Security Center will recommend that you edit these inbound rules to restrict access to source IP addresses that actually need access.

This recommendation is generated for any non-web port that has "any" as source.

> [!NOTE]
> This document introduces the service by using an example deployment. This is not a step-by-step guide.

## Implement the recommendation
1. In the **Recommendations blade**, select **Restrict access through Internet facing endpoint**.

2. This opens the blade **Restrict access through Internet facing endpoint**. This blade lists the virtual machines (VMs) with inbound rules that create a potential security issue. Select a VM.

3. The **NSG** blade displays Network Security Group information, related inbound rules, and the associated VM. Select **Edit inbound rules** to proceed with editing an inbound rule.

4. On the **Inbound security rules** blade select the inbound rule to edit. In this example, let’s select **AllowWeb**.

   Note, you can also select **Default rules** to see the set of default rules contained by all NSGs. The default rules cannot be deleted but, because they are assigned a lower priority, they can be overridden by the rules that you create. Learn more about [default rules](../virtual-network/ virtual-networks-nsg.md#default-rules).

5. On the **AllowWeb** blade, edit the properties of the inbound rule so that the **Source** is an IP address or block of IP addresses. To learn more about the properties of the inbound rule, see [NSG rules](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-nsg.md#nsg-rules).
