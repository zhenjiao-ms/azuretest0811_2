# Protecting your applications in Azure Security Center
Azure Security Center analyzes the security state of your Azure resources. When Security Center identifies potential security vulnerabilities, it creates recommendations that guide you through the process of configuring the needed controls.  Recommendations apply to Azure resource types: virtual machines (VMs), networking, SQL, and applications.

This article addresses recommendations that apply to applications.  Application recommendations center around deployment of a web application firewall.  Use the table below as a reference to help you understand the available application recommendations and what each one will do if you apply it.

## Available application recommendations
| Recommendation | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Add a web application firewall](security-center-add-web-application-firewall.md) |Recommends that you deploy a web application firewall (WAF) for web endpoints. You can protect multiple web applications in Security Center by adding these applications to your existing WAF deployments. WAF appliances (created using the Resource Manager deployment model) need to be deployed to a separate virtual network. WAF appliances (created using the classic deployment model) are restricted to using a network security group. This support will be extended to a fully customized deployment of a WAF appliance (classic) in the future. |
| [Finalize application protection](security-center-add-web-application-firewall.md#finalize-application-protection) |To complete the configuration of a WAF, traffic must be rerouted to the WAF appliance. Following this recommendation will complete the necessary setup changes. |
