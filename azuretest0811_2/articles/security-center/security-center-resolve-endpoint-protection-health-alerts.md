# Resolve endpoint protection health alerts in Azure Security Center
Azure Security Center will recommend that you resolve detected endpoint protection health alerts.  Security Center enables you to see which virtual machines (VMs) have endpoint protection failures and how many failures.

> [!NOTE]
> This document introduces the service by using an example deployment. This is not a step-by-step guide.

## Implement the recommendation
1. In the **Recommendations blade**, select **Resolve Endpoint Protection health alerts**.

2. This opens the blade **Endpoint Protection failure** which lists VMs with failures and the number of failures for each VM. Select a VM from the list.

3. A **Failures List** blade opens for the selected VM, displaying a list of failures. Select a failure from the list to learn more. This opens a blade with information about the selected failure.
