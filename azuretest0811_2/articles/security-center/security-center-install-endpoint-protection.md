# Install Endpoint Protection in Azure Security Center
Azure Security Center will recommend that you provision an antimalware program to your Azure virtual machines (VMs) if antimalware is not already enabled. This recommendation applies to Windows VMs only.

> [!NOTE]
> This document introduces the service by using an example deployment.  This is not a step-by-step guide.

## Implement the recommendation
1. In the **Recommendations** blade, select **Install Endpoint Protection**.
   ![Select Install Endpoint Protection](./media/security-center-install-endpoint-protection/select-install-endpoint-protection.png)
2. The **Install Endpoint Protection** blade opens displaying a list of VMs without antimalware enabled. Select from the list the VMs that you want to install antimalware on and click **Install on VMs**.

3. The **Select Endpoint Protection** blade opens to allow you to select the antimalware solution you want to use. In this example, let's select **Microsoft Antimalware**.

4. Additional information about the antimalware solution is displayed. Select **Create**.
   ![Create antimalware solution](./media/security-center-install-endpoint-protection/create-antimalware-solution.png)
5. Enter the required configuration settings on the **Add Extension** blade, and then select **OK**. To learn more about the configuration settings, see [Default and Custom Antimalware Configuration](../azure-security-antimalware.md#default-and-custom-antimalware-configuration).

[Microsoft Antimalware](../azure-security-antimalware.md) is now active on the selected VMs.
