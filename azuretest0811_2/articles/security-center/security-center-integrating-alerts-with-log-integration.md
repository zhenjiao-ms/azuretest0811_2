# Integrating Security Center alerts with Azure log integration (Preview)
Many security operations and incident response teams rely on a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution as the starting point for triaging and investigating security alerts. With Azure log integration, customers can sync Azure Security Center alerts, along with virtual machine security events collected by Azure Diagnostics and Azure Audit logs, with their log analytics or SIEM solution in near real-time.

Azure log integration works with HP ArcSight, Splunk, IBM Qradar, and others. To get started, download [Azure log integration](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=53324).
