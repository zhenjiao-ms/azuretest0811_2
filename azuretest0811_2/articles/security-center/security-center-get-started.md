# Azure Security Center quick start guide
This document helps you get started quickly with Azure Security Center by guiding you through the security monitoring and policy management components and linking you to next steps.

> [!NOTE]
> This document introduces the service by using an example deployment. This is not a step-by-step guide.

## Data collection
Security Center collects data from your virtual machines in order to assess their security state, provide security recommendations, and alert you to threats. When you first access Security Center, data collection is enabled on all virtual machines in your subscription. Data collection is recommended but you can opt-out by turning data collection off in the Security Center policy. The following steps show you how to turn data collection off.

## Prerequisites
To get started with Security Center, you must have a subscription to Microsoft Azure. Security Center is enabled with your subscription. If you do not have a subscription, you can sign up for a [free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

Security Center is accessed from the [Azure portal](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/azure-portal/). See the [portal documentation](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/services/azure-portal/) to learn more.

## Access Security Center
In the portal, follow these steps to access Security Center:

1. Select **Browse**, and then scroll to the **Security Center** option.
   ![Access Azure Security Center in the portal](./media/security-center-get-started/security-tile.png)
2. Select **Security Center**. This opens the **Security Center** blade.
3. For easy access to the **Security Center** blade in the future, select the **Pin blade to dashboard** option (top right).
   ![Pin blade to dashboard option](./media/security-center-get-started/pin-blade.png)

## Use Security Center
You can configure security policies for your Azure subscriptions and resource groups. Let's configure a security **policy** for your subscription:

1. Select the **Policy** tile on the **Security Center** blade.
   ![Security Center](./media/security-center-get-started/security-center.png)
2. On the **Security policy-Define policy per subscription or resource group** blade, select a subscription.
   ![The security policy blade in Azure Security Center](./media/security-center-get-started/security-policy.png)
3. On the **Security policy** blade, **Data collection** is enabled to automatically collect logs. The monitoring extension is provisioned on all current and new VMs in the subscription. (You can opt-out of data collection by setting **Data collection** to Off but this will prevent Security Center from providing you with security alerts and recommendations.)
4. Select **Choose a storage account per region**. For each region in which you have virtual machines running, you choose the storage account where data collected from those virtual machines is stored. If you do not choose a storage account for each region, it will be created for you. The data that's collected is logically isolated from other customers’ data for security reasons.
   
   > [!NOTE]
   > We recommend that you enable data collection and choose a storage account at the subscription level first.  Security policies can be set at the Azure subscription level and resource group level but configuration of data collection and storage account occurs at the subscription level only.
   > 
5. Turn on the **Recommendations** you’d like to see as part of your security policy. Examples:
   
   * Turning on **System updates** will scan all supported virtual machines for missing OS updates.
   * Turning on **OS vulnerabilities** will scan all supported virtual machines to identify any OS configurations that could make the virtual machine more vulnerable to attack.

Address **Recommendations**:

1. Return to the **Security Center** blade and select the **Recommendations** tile. Security Center periodically analyzes the security state of your Azure resources. When potential security vulnerabilities are identified, a recommendation is shown here.
2. Select each recommendation to view more information and/or to take action to resolve the issue.
   ![Recommendations in Azure Security Center](./media/security-center-get-started/recommendations.png)

View the health and security state of your resources via **Resource security health**:

1. Return to the **Security Center** blade.
2. The **Resources security health** tile contains indicators of the security state for **Virtual machines**, **Networking**, **SQL**, and **Applications**.
3. Select **Virtual machines** to view more information.
4. The **Virtual machines** blade displays a status summary that shows the status of antimalware programs, system updates, restarts, and the baseline rules of your virtual machines.
5. Select an item under **VIRTUAL MACHINE RECOMMENDATIONS** to view more information and/or to take action to configure necessary controls.
6. Drill down to view additional information for specific virtual machines.

Address **Security alerts**:

1. Return to the **Security Center** blade and select the **Security alerts** tile. On the **Security alerts** blade, a list of alerts is displayed. The alerts are generated by the Security Center analysis of your security logs and network activity. Alerts from integrated partner solutions are also included.

2. Select an alert to view additional information.

View the health of your **Partner solutions**:

1. Return to the **Security Center** blade. The **Partner solutions** tile lets you monitor at a glance the health status of your partner solutions integrated with your Azure subscription.
2. Select the **Partner solutions** tile. A blade opens displaying a list of your partner solutions connected to Security Center.
   ![Partner solutions](./media/security-center-get-started/partner-solutions.png)
3. Select a partner solution. In this example, lets select the **F5-WAF2** solution.  A blade opens showing you the status of the partner solution and the solution's associated resources. Select **Solution console** to open the partner management experience for this solution.
