# Add a web application firewall in Azure Security Center
Azure Security Center may recommend that you add a web application firewall (WAF) from a Microsoft partner in order to secure your web applications. This document walks you through an example of how to do this.

> [!NOTE]
> This document introduces the service by using an example deployment.  This is not a step-by-step guide.

> 

## Implement the recommendation
1. In the **Recommendations** blade, select **Secure web application using web application firewall**.
   ![Secure web Application](./media/security-center-add-web-application-firewall/secure-web-application.png)
2. In the **Secure your web applications using web application firewall** blade, select a web application. The **Add a Web Application Firewall** blade opens.
   ![Add a web application firewall](./media/security-center-add-web-application-firewall/add-a-waf.png)
3. You can choose to use an existing web application firewall if available or you can create a new one. In this example there are no existing WAFs available so we'll create a new WAF.
4. To create a new WAF, select a solution from the list of integrated partners. In this example we will select **Barracuda Web Application Firewall**.
5. The **Barracuda Web Application Firewall** blade opens providing you information about the partner solution. Select **Create** in the information blade.
   ![Firewall information blade](./media/security-center-add-web-application-firewall/info-blade.png)
6. The **New Web Application Firewall** blade opens, where you can perform **VM Configuration** steps and provide **WAF Information**. Select **VM Configuration**.
7. In the **VM Configuration** blade you enter information required to spin up the virtual machine that will run the WAF.
   ![VM configuration](./media/security-center-add-web-application-firewall/select-vm-config.png)
8. Return to the **New Web Application Firewall** blade and select **WAF Information**. In the **WAF Information** blade you configure the WAF itself. Step 7 allows you to configure the virtual machine on which the WAF will run and step 8 enables you to provision the WAF itself.

## Finalize application protection
1. Return to the **Recommendations** blade. A new entry was generated after you created the WAF, called **Finalize application protection**. This entry lets you know that you need to complete the process of actually wiring up the WAF within the Azure Virtual Network so that it can protect the application.
   ![Finalize application protection](./media/security-center-add-web-application-firewall/finalize-waf.png)
2. Select **Finalize application protection**. A new blade opens. You can see that there is a web application that needs to have its traffic rerouted.
3. Select the web application. A blade opens that gives you steps for finalizing the web application firewall setup. Complete the steps, and then select **Restrict traffic**. Security Center will then do the wiring-up for you.

> [!NOTE]
> You can protect multiple web applications in Security Center by adding these applications to your existing WAF deployments. WAF appliances (created using the Resource Manager deployment model) need to be deployed to a separate virtual network. WAF appliances (created using the classic deployment model) are restricted to using a network security group. This support will be extended to a fully customized deployment of a WAF appliance (classic) in the future. Learn more about the [classic and Resource Manager deployment models](../azure-classic-rm.md) for Azure resources.

> 

The logs from that WAF are now fully integrated. Security Center can start automatically gathering and analyzing the logs so that it can surface important security alerts to you.
