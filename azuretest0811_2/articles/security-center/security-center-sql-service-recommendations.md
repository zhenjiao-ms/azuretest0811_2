# Protecting Azure SQL service in Azure Security Center
Azure Security Center analyzes the security state of your Azure resources. When Security Center identifies potential security vulnerabilities, it creates recommendations that guide you through the process of configuring the needed controls.  Recommendations apply to Azure resource types: virtual machines (VMs), networking, SQL, and applications.

This article addresses recommendations that apply to Azure SQL service.  Azure SQL service recommendations center around enabling auditing for Azure SQL servers and databases and enabling encryption for SQL databases.  Use the table below as a reference to help you understand the available SQL service recommendations and what each one will do if you apply it.

## Available SQL service recommendations
| Recommendation | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Enable server SQL Auditing](security-center-enable-auditing-on-sql-servers.md) |Recommends that you turn on auditing for Azure SQL servers (Azure SQL service only; doesn't include SQL running on your virtual machines). |
| [Enable database SQL Auditing](security-center-enable-auditing-on-sql-databases.md) |Recommends that you turn on auditing for Azure SQL databases (Azure SQL service only; doesn't include SQL running on your virtual machines). |
| [Enable Transparent Data Encryption on SQL databases](security-center-enable-transparent-data-encryption.md) |Recommends that you enable encryption for SQL databases (Azure SQL service only). |
