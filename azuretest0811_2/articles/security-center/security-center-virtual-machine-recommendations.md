# Protecting your virtual machines in Azure Security Center
Azure Security Center analyzes the security state of your Azure resources. When Security Center identifies potential security vulnerabilities, it creates recommendations that guide you through the process of configuring the needed controls.  Recommendations apply to Azure resource types: virtual machines (VMs), networking, SQL, and applications.

This article addresses recommendations that apply to VMs.  VM recommendations center around data collection, applying system updates, provisioning antimalware, encrypting your VM disks, and more.  Use the table below as a reference to help you understand the available VM recommendations and what each one will do if you apply it.

## Available VM recommendations
| Recommendation | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Enable data collection for subscriptions](security-center-enable-data-collection.md) |Recommends that you turn on data collection in the security policy for each of your subscriptions and all virtual machines (VMs) in your subscriptions. |
| [Remediate OS vulnerabilities](security-center-remediate-os-vulnerabilities.md) |Recommends that you align your OS configurations with the recommended configuration rules, e.g. do not allow passwords to be saved. |
| [Apply system updates](security-center-apply-system-updates.md) |Recommends that you deploy missing system security and critical updates to VMs. |
| [Reboot after system updates](security-center-apply-system-updates.md#reboot-after-system-updates) |Recommends that you reboot a VM to complete the process of applying system updates. |
| [Install Endpoint Protection](security-center-install-endpoint-protection.md) |Recommends that you provision antimalware programs to VMs (Windows VMs only). |
| [Resolve Endpoint Protection health alerts](security-center-resolve-endpoint-protection-health-alerts.md) |Recommends that you resolve endpoint protection failures. |
| [Enable VM Agent](security-center-enable-vm-agent.md) |Enables you to see which VMs require the VM Agent. The VM Agent must be installed on VMs in order to provision patch scanning, baseline scanning, and antimalware programs. The VM Agent is installed by default for VMs that are deployed from the Azure Marketplace. The article [VM Agent and Extensions â€“ Part 2](http://azure.microsoft.com/blog/2014/04/15/vm-agent-and-extensions-part-2/) provides information on how to install the VM Agent. |
| [Apply disk encryption](security-center-apply-disk-encryption.md) |Recommends that you encrypt your VM disks using Azure Disk Encryption (Windows and Linux VMs). Encryption is recommended for both the OS and data volumes on your VM. |
| [Update OS version](security-center-update-os-version.md) |Recommends that you update the operating system (OS) version for your Cloud Service to the most recent version available for your OS family.  To learn more about Cloud Services, see the [Cloud Services overview](../cloud-services/cloud-services-choose-me.md). |
