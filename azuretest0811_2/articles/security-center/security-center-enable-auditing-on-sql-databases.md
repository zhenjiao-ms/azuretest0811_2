# Enable auditing on SQL databases in Azure Security Center
Azure Security Center will recommend that you turn on auditing for all SQL databases if auditing is not already enabled. Auditing can help you maintain regulatory compliance, understand database activity, and gain insight into discrepancies and anomalies that could indicate business concerns or suspected security violations.

Once youâ€™ve turned on auditing you can configure Threat Detection settings and emails to receive security alerts. Threat Detection detects anomalous database activities indicating potential security threats to the database. This enables you to detect and respond to potential threats as they occur.

This recommendation applies to the Azure SQL service only; doesn't include SQL running on your virtual machines.

> This document introduces the service by using an example deployment.  This is not a step-by-step guide.

## Implement the recommendation
1. In the **Recommendations** blade, select **Enable Auditing on SQL databases**.  This opens the **Enable Auditing on SQL databases** blade.

2. Select a SQL database to enable auditing on. This opens the **Auditing & Threat detection** blade.

4. Follow the steps in [Get started with SQL Database Threat Detection](../sql-database/sql-database-threat-detection-get-started.md) to turn on and configure Threat Detection and to configure the list of emails that will receive security alerts upon detection of anomalous activities.
