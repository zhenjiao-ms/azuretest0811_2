# Apply system updates in Azure Security Center
Azure Security Center monitors daily Windows and  Linux virtual machines (VMs) for missing operating system updates. Security Center retrieves a list of available security and critical updates from Windows Update or Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), depending on which service is configured on a Windows VM.  Security Center also checks for the latest updates in Linux systems. If your VM is missing a system update, Security Center will recommend that you apply system updates

> [!NOTE]
> This document introduces the service by using an example deployment.  This is not a step-by-step guide.

## Implement the recommendation
1. In the **Recommendations** blade, select **Apply system updates**.

2. The **Apply system updates** blade opens displaying a list of VMs missing system updates. Select a VM.

3. A blade opens displaying a list of missing updates for that VM. Select a system update. In this example, letâ€™s select KB3156016.

4. Follow the steps in the **Security Update** blade to apply the missing update.

## Reboot after system updates
1. Return to the **Recommendations** blade. A new entry was generated after you applied system updates, called **Reboot after system updates**. This entry lets you know that you need to reboot the VM to complete the process of applying system updates.

2. Select **Reboot after system updates**. This opens **A restart is pending to complete system updates** blade displaying a list of VMs that you need to restart to complete the apply system updates process.

Restart the VM from Azure to complete the process.
