# Debugging apps in a local Docker container
## Overview
The Visual Studio Tools for Docker provides a consistent way to develop in a and validate your application locally in a Linux Docker container.
You don't have to restart the container each time you make a code change.
This article will illustrate how to use the "Edit and Refresh" feature to start an ASP.NET Core Web app in a local Docker container,
make any necessary changes, and then refresh the browser to see those changes.
It will also show you how to set breakpoints for debugging.

> [!NOTE]
> Windows Container support will be coming in a future release

## Prerequisites
The following tools need to be installed.

* [Visual Studio 2015 Update 2](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691978)
* [Microsoft ASP .NET Core RC 2](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=798481)
* [Visual Studio 2015 Tools for Docker](https://aka.ms/DockerToolsForVS)

To run Docker containers locally, you'll need a local docker client.
You can use the released [Docker Toolbox](https://www.docker.com/products/overview#/docker_toolbox) which requires Hyper-V to be disabled,
or you can use [Docker for Windows Beta](https://beta.docker.com) which uses Hyper-V, and requires Windows 10.

If using Docker Toolbox, you'll need to [configure the Docker client](vs-azure-tools-docker-setup.md)

## 1. Create a web app
[!INCLUDE [create-aspnet5-app](../includes/create-aspnet5-app.md)]

## 2. Add Docker support
[!INCLUDE [Add docker support](../includes/vs-azure-tools-docker-add-docker-support.md)]

## 3. Edit your code and refresh
To quickly iterate changes, you can start your application within a container, and continue to make changes, viewing them as you would with IIS Express.

1. Set the Solution Configuration to `Debug` and press **&lt;CTRL + F5>** to build your docker image and run it locally.
   
    Once the container image has been built and is running in a Docker container, Visual Studio will launch the Web app in your default browser.
    If you are using the Microsoft Edge browser or otherwise have errors, see [Troubleshooting](vs-azure-tools-docker-troubleshooting-docker-errors.md) section.
2. Go to the About page, which is where we're going to make our changes.
3. Return to Visual Studio and open `Views\Home\About.cshtml`.
4. Add the following HTML content to the end of the file and save the changes.
   
    ```
    <h1>Hello from a Docker Container!</h1>
    ```
5. Viewing the output window, when the .NET build is completed and you see these lines, switch back to your browser and refresh the About page.
   
   ```
   Now listening on: http://*:80
   Application started. Press Ctrl+C to shut down
   ```
6. Your changes have been applied!

## 4. Debug with breakpoints
Often, changes will need further inspection, leveraging the debugging features of Visual Studio.

1. Return to Visual Studio and open `Controllers\HomeController.cs`
2. Replace the contents of the About() method with the following:
   
   ```
   string message = "Your application description page from wthin a Container";
   ViewData["Message"] = message;
   ````
3. Set a breakpoint to the left of the `string message`... line.
4. Hit **&lt;F5>** to start debugging.
5. Navigate to the About page to hit your breakpoint.
6. Switch to Visual Studio to view the breakpoint, and inspect the value of message.

## Summary
With [Visual Studio 2015 Tools for Docker](https://aka.ms/DockerToolsForVS), you can get the productivity of working locally,
with the production realism of developing within a Docker container.
