# Use Azure Functions to perform a scheduled clean-up task
This topic shows you how to use Azure Functions to create a new function in C# that runs based on an event timer to clean-up rows in a database table. The new function is created based on a pre-defined template in the Azure Functions portal. To support this scenario, you must also set a database connection string as an App Service setting in the function app. 

## Prerequisites
Before you can create a function, you need to have an active Azure account. If you don't already have an Azure account, [free accounts are available](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

This topic demonstrates a Transact-SQL command that executes a bulk cleanup operation in table named *TodoItems* in a SQL Database. This same TodoItems table is created when you complete the [Azure App Service Mobile Apps quickstart tutorial](../app-service-mobile/app-service-mobile-ios-get-started.md). You can also use a sample database  If you choose to use a different table, you will need to modify the command.

You can get the connection string used by a Mobile App backend in the portal under **All settings** > **Application settings** > **Connection strings** > **Show connection string values** > **MS_TableConnectionString**. You can also get the connection string direct from a SQL Database in the portal under **All settings** > **Properties** > **Show database connection strings** > **ADO.NET (SQL authentication)**.

This scenario uses a bulk operation against the database. To have your function process individual CRUD operations in a Mobile Apps table, you should instead use Mobile Table binding.

## Set a SQL Database connection string in the function app
A function app hosts the execution of your functions in Azure. It is a best practice to store connection strings and other secrets in your function app settings. This prevents accidental disclosure when your function code ends-up in a repo somewhere. 

1. Go to the [Azure Functions portal](https://functions.azure.com/signin) and sign-in with your Azure account.
2. If you have an existing function app to use, select it from **Your function apps** then click **Open**. To create a new function app, type a unique **Name** for your new function app or accept the generated one, select your preferred **Region**, then click **Create + get started**. 
3. In your function app, click **Function app settings** > **Go to App Service settings**. 
   
    ![Function app settings blade](./media/functions-create-an-event-processing-function/functions-app-service-settings.png)
4. In your function app, click **All settings**, scroll down to **Application settings**, then under **Connection strings** type `sqldb_connection` for **Name**, paste the connection string into **Value**, click **Save**, then close the function app blade to return to the Functions portal.

Now, you can add the C# function code that connects to your SQL Database.

## Create a timer-triggered function from the template
1. In your function app, click **+ New Function** > **TimerTrigger - C#** > **Create**. This creates a function with a default name that is run on the default schedule of once every minute.

2. In the **Code** pane in the **Develop** tab, add the following assembly references at the top of the existing function code:
   
        #r "System.Configuration"
        #r "System.Data"
3. Add the following `using` statements to the function:
   
        using System.Configuration;
        using System.Data.SqlClient;
        using System.Threading.Tasks; 
4. Replace the existing **Run** function with the following code:
   
        public static async Task Run(TimerInfo myTimer, TraceWriter log)
        {
            var str = ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings["sqldb_connection"].ConnectionString;
            using (SqlConnection conn = new SqlConnection(str))
            {
                conn.Open();
                var text = "DELETE from dbo.TodoItems WHERE Complete='True'";
                using (SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand(text, conn))
                {
                    // Execute the command and log the # rows deleted.
                    var rows = await cmd.ExecuteNonQueryAsync();
                    log.Info($"{rows} rows were deleted");
                }
            }
        }
5. Click **Save**, watch the **Logs** windows for the next function execution, then note the number of rows deleted from the TodoItems table.
6. (Optional) Using the [Mobile Apps quickstart app](../app-service-mobile/app-service-mobile-ios-get-started.md), mark additional items as "completed" then return to the **Logs** window and watch the same number of rows get deleted by the function during the next execution.
