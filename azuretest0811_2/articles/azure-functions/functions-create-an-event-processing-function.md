# Create an event processing Azure Function
Azure Functions is an event-driven, compute-on-demand experience that enables you to create scheduled or triggered units of code implemented in a variety of programming languages. To learn more about Azure Functions, see the [Azure Functions Overview](functions-overview.md).

This topic shows you how to create a new function in C# that executes based on an event timer to add messages to a storage queue. 

## Prerequisites
Before you can create a function, you need to have an active Azure account. If you don't already have an Azure account, [free accounts are available](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

## Create a timer-triggered function from the template
A function app hosts the execution of your functions in Azure. Before you can create a function, you need to have an active Azure account. If you don't already have an Azure account, [free accounts are available](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/). 

1. Go to the [Azure Functions portal](https://functions.azure.com/signin) and sign-in with your Azure account.
2. If you have an existing function app to use, select it from **Your function apps** then click **Open**. To create a new function app, type a unique **Name** for your new function app or accept the generated one, select your preferred **Region**, then click **Create + get started**. 
3. In your function app, click **+ New Function** > **TimerTrigger - C#** > **Create**. This creates a function with a default name that is run on the default schedule of once every minute.

4. In your new function, click the **Integrate** tab > **New Output** > **Azure Storage Queue** > **Select**.

5. In  **Azure Storage Queue output**, click **select** next to **Storage account connection**, select the existing storage account or create a new one, then click **Save**.

6. Back in the **Develop** tab, replace the existing C# script in the **Code** window with the following code:
   
        using System;
   
        public static void Run(TimerInfo myTimer, out string outputQueueItem, TraceWriter log)
        {
            // Add a new scheduled message to the queue.
            outputQueueItem = $"Ping message added to the queue at: {DateTime.Now}.";
   
            // Also write the message to the logs.
            log.Info(outputQueueItem);
        }
   
    This code adds a new message to the queue with the current date and time when the function is executed.
7. Click **Save** and watch the **Logs** windows for the next function execution.
8. (Optional) Navigate to the storage account and verify that messages are being added to the queue.
9. Go back to the **Integrate** tab and change the schedule field to `0 0 * * * *`. The function now runs once every hour. 

This is a very simplified example of both a timer trigger and a storage queue output binding. For more information, see both the [Azure Functions timer trigger](functions-bindings-timer.md) and the [Azure Functions triggers and bindings for Azure Storage](functions-bindings-storage.md) topics.
