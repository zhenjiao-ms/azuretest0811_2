The Node/JavaScript experience for Azure Functions makes it easy to export a function which is passed a `context` object for communicating with the runtime, and for receiving and sending data via bindings.

This article assumes that you've already read the [Azure Functions developer reference](functions-reference.md).

## Exporting a function
All JavaScript functions must export a single `function` via `module.exports` for the runtime to find the function and run it. This function must always include a `context` object.

```javascript
// You must include a context, but other arguments are optional
module.exports = function(context) {
    // Additional inputs can be accessed by the arguments property
    if(arguments.length === 4) {
        context.log('This function has 4 inputs');
    }
};
// or you can include additional inputs in your arguments
module.exports = function(context, myTrigger, myInput, myOtherInput) {
    // function logic goes here :)
};
```

Bindings of `direction === "in"` are passed along as function arguments, meaning you can use [`arguments`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/87dw3w1k.aspx) to dynamically handle new inputs (for example, by using `arguments.length` to iterate over all your inputs). This functionality is very convenient if you only have a trigger with no additional inputs, as you can predictably access your trigger data without referencing your `context` object.

The arguments are always passed along to the function in the order they occur in *function.json*, even if you don't specify them in your exports statement. For example, if you have `function(context, a, b)` and change it to `function(context, a)`, you can still get the value of `b` in function code by referring to `arguments[3]`.

All bindings, regardless of direction, are also passed along on the `context` object (see below). 

## context object
The runtime uses a `context` object to pass data to and from your function and to let you communicate with the runtime.

The context object is always the first parameter to a function and should always be included because it has methods such as `context.done` and `context.log` which are required to correctly use the runtime. You can name the object whatever you like (i.e. `ctx` or `c`).

```javascript
// You must include a context, but other arguments are optional
module.exports = function(context) {
    // function logic goes here :)
};
```

## context.bindings
The `context.bindings` object collects all your input and output data. The data is added onto the `context.bindings` object via the `name` property of the binding. For instance, given the following binding definition in *function.json*, you can access the contents of the queue via `context.bindings.myInput`. 

```json
    {
        "type":"queue",
        "direction":"in",
        "name":"myInput"
        ...
    }
```

```javascript
// myInput contains the input data which may have properties such as "name"
var author = context.bindings.myInput.name;
// Similarly, you can set your output data
context.bindings.myOutput = { 
        some_text: 'hello world', 
        a_number: 1 };
```

## `context.done([err],[propertyBag])`
The `context.done` function tells the runtime that you're done running. This is important to call when you're done with the function; if you don't, the runtime will still never know that your function completed. 

The `context.done` function allows you to pass back a user-defined error to the runtime, as well as a property bag of properties which will overwrite the properties on the `context.bindings` object.

```javascript
// Even though we set myOutput to have:
//  -> text: hello world, number: 123
context.bindings.myOutput = { text: 'hello world', number: 123 };
// If we pass an object to the done function...
context.done(null, { myOutput: { text: 'hello there, world', noNumber: true }});
// the done method will overwrite the myOutput binding to be: 
//  -> text: hello there, world, noNumber: true
```

## context.log(message)
The `context.log` method allows you to output log statements that are correlated together for logging purposes. If you use `console.log`, your messages will only show for process level logging, which isn't as useful.

```javascript
/* You can use context.log to log output specific to this 
function. You can access your bindings via context.bindings */
context.log({hello: 'world'}); // logs: { 'hello': 'world' } 
```

The `context.log` method supports the same parameter format that the Node [util.format method](https://nodejs.org/api/util.html#util_util_format_format) supports. So, for example, code like this:

```javascript
context.log('Node.js HTTP trigger function processed a request. RequestUri=' + req.originalUrl);
context.log('Request Headers = ' + JSON.stringify(req.headers));
```

can be written like this:

```javascript
context.log('Node.js HTTP trigger function processed a request. RequestUri=%s', req.originalUrl);
context.log('Request Headers = ', JSON.stringify(req.headers));
```

## HTTP triggers: context.req and context.res
In the case of HTTP Triggers, because it is such a common pattern to use `req` and `res` for the HTTP request and response objects, we decided to make it easy to access those on the context object, instead of forcing you to use the full `context.bindings.name` pattern.

```javascript
// You can access your http request off of the context ...
if(context.req.body.emoji === ':pizza:') context.log('Yay!');
// and also set your http response
context.res = { status: 202, body: 'You successfully ordered more coffee!' };   
```

## Node Version & Package Management
The node version is currently locked at `5.9.1`. We're investigating adding support for more versions and making it configurable.

You can include packages in your function by 
uploading a *package.json* file to your function's folder in the function app's file system. For file upload instructions, see the **How to update function app files** section of the [Azure Functions developer reference topic](functions-reference.md#fileupdate). 

You can also use `npm install` in the function app's SCM (Kudu) command line interface:

1. Navigate to: `https://<function_app_name>.scm.azurewebsites.net`.
2. Click **Debug Console > CMD**.
3. Navigate to `D:\home\site\wwwroot\<function_name>`.
4. Run `npm install`.

Once the packages you need are installed, you import them to your function in the usual ways (i.e. via `require('packagename')`)

```javascript
// Import the underscore.js library
var _ = require('underscore');
var version = process.version; // version === 'v5.9.1'

module.exports = function(context) {
    // Using our imported underscore.js library
    var matched_names = _
        .where(context.bindings.myInput.names, {first: 'Carla'});
```

## Environment variables
To get an environment variable or an app setting value, use `process.env`, as shown in the following code example:

```javascript
module.exports = function (context, myTimer) {
    var timeStamp = new Date().toISOString();

    context.log('Node.js timer trigger function ran!', timeStamp);   
    context.log(GetEnvironmentVariable("AzureWebJobsStorage"));
    context.log(GetEnvironmentVariable("WEBSITE_SITE_NAME"));

    context.done();
};

function GetEnvironmentVariable(name)
{
    return name + ": " + process.env[name];
}
```

## TypeScript/CoffeeScript support
There isn't, yet, any direct support for auto-compiling TypeScript/CoffeeScript via the runtime, so that would all need to be handled outside the runtime, at deployment time.
