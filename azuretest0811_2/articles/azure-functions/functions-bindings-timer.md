# Azure Functions timer trigger
This article explains how to configure timer triggers in Azure Functions. Timer triggers call functions based on a schedule, one time or recurring.  

[!INCLUDE [intro](../../includes/functions-bindings-intro.md)]

## function.json for timer trigger
The *function.json* file provides a schedule expression.

```json
{
  "bindings": [
    {
      "schedule": "0 * * * * *",
      "name": "myTimer",
      "type": "timerTrigger",
      "direction": "in"
    }
  ],
  "disabled": false
}
```

The timer trigger handles multi-instance scale-out automatically: only a single instance of a particular timer function will be running across all instances.

## Format of schedule expression
The schedule expression is a [CRON expression](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#CRON_expression) that includes 6 fields:  {second} {minute} {hour} {day} {month} {day of the week}. Many of the cron expression documents you find online omit the {second} field, so if you copy from one of those you'll have to adjust for the extra field. 

Here are some schedule expression examples.

To trigger once every 5 minutes:

```json
"schedule": "0 */5 * * * *"
```

To trigger once every two hours:

```json
"schedule": "0 0 */2 * * *",
```

## Timer trigger C# code example
This C# code example writes a single log each time the function is triggered.

```csharp
public static void Run(TimerInfo myTimer, TraceWriter log)
{
    log.Info($"C# Timer trigger function executed at: {DateTime.Now}");    
}
```
