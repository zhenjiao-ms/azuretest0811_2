The C# experience for Azure Functions is based on the Azure WebJobs SDK. Data flows into your C# function via method arguments. Argument names are specified in `function.json`, and there are predefined names for accessing things like the function logger and cancellation tokens.

This article assumes that you've already read the [Azure Functions developer reference](functions-reference.md).

## How .csx works
The `.csx` format allows to write less "boilerplate" and focus on writing just a C# function. For Azure Functions, you just include any assembly references and namespaces you need up top, as usual, and instead of wrapping everything in a namespace and class, you can just define your `Run` method. If you need to include any classes, for instance to define POCO objects, you can include a class inside the same file.

## Binding to arguments
The various bindings are bound to a C# function via the `name` property in the *function.json* configuration. Each binding has its own supported types which is documented per binding; for instance, a blob trigger can support a string, a POCO, or several other types. You can use the type which best suits your need. 

```csharp
public static void Run(string myBlob, out MyClass myQueueItem)
{
    log.Verbose($"C# Blob trigger function processed: {myBlob}");
    myQueueItem = new MyClass() { Id = "myid" };
}

public class MyClass
{
    public string Id { get; set; }
}
```

## Logging
To log output to your streaming logs in C#, you can include a `TraceWriter` typed argument. We recommend that you name it `log`. We recommend you avoid `Console.Write` in Azure Functions.

```csharp
public static void Run(string myBlob, TraceWriter log)
{
    log.Info($"C# Blob trigger function processed: {myBlob}");
}
```

## Async
To make a function asynchronous, use the `async` keyword and return a `Task` object.

```csharp
public async static Task ProcessQueueMessageAsync(
        string blobName, 
        Stream blobInput,
        Stream blobOutput)
    {
        await blobInput.CopyToAsync(blobOutput, 4096, token);
    }
```

## Cancellation Token
In certain cases, you may have operations which are sensitive to being shut down. While it's always best to write code which can handle crashing,  in cases where you want to handle graceful shutdown requests, you define a [`CancellationToken`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.threading.cancellationtoken.aspx) typed argument.  A `CancellationToken` will be provided if a host shutdown is triggered. 

```csharp
public async static Task ProcessQueueMessageAsyncCancellationToken(
        string blobName, 
        Stream blobInput,
        Stream blobOutput,
        CancellationToken token)
    {
        await blobInput.CopyToAsync(blobOutput, 4096, token);
    }
```

## Importing namespaces
If you need to import namespaces, you can do so as usual, with the `using` clause.

```csharp
using System.Net;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public static Task<HttpResponseMessage> Run(HttpRequestMessage req, TraceWriter log)
```

The following namespaces are automatically imported and are therefore optional:

* `System`
* `System.Collections.Generic`
* `System.IO`
* `System.Linq`
* `System.Net.Http`
* `System.Threading.Tasks`
* `Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs`
* `Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Host`.

## Referencing External Assemblies
For framework assemblies, add references by using the `#r "AssemblyName"` directive.

```csharp
#r "System.Web.Http"

using System.Net;
using System.Net.Http;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public static Task<HttpResponseMessage> Run(HttpRequestMessage req, TraceWriter log)
```

The following assemblies are automatically added by the Azure Functions hosting environment:

* `mscorlib`,
* `System`
* `System.Core`
* `System.Xml`
* `System.Net.Http`
* `Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs`
* `Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Host`
* `Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions`
* `System.Web.Http`
* `System.Net.Http.Formatting`.

In addition, the following assemblies are special cased and may be referenced by simplename (e.g. `#r "AssemblyName"`):

* `Newtonsoft.Json`
* `Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage`
* `Microsoft.ServiceBus`
* `Microsoft.AspNet.WebHooks.Receivers`
* `Microsoft.AspNEt.WebHooks.Common`.

If you need to reference a private assembly, you can upload the assembly file into a `bin` folder relative to your function and reference it by using the file name (e.g.  `#r "MyAssembly.dll"`). For information on how to upload files to your function folder, see the following section on package management.

## Package management
To use NuGet packages in a C# function, upload a *project.json* file to the the function's folder in the function app's file system. Here is an example *project.json* file that adds a reference to Microsoft.ProjectOxford.Face version 1.1.0:

```json
{
  "frameworks": {
    "net46":{
      "dependencies": {
        "Microsoft.ProjectOxford.Face": "1.1.0"
      }
    }
   }
}
```

Only the .NET Framework 4.6 is supported, so make sure that your *project.json* file specifies `net46` as shown here.

When you upload a *project.json* file, the runtime gets the packages and automatically adds references to the package assemblies. You don't need to add `#r "AssemblyName"` directives. Just add the required `using` statements to your *run.csx* file to use the types defined in the NuGet packages.

### How to upload a project.json file
1. Begin by making sure your function app is running, which you can do by opening your function in the Azure portal. 
   
    This also gives access to the streaming logs where package installation output will be displayed. 
2. To upload a project.json file, use one of the methods described in the **How to update function app files** section of the [Azure Functions developer reference topic](functions-reference.md#fileupdate). 
3. After the *project.json* file is uploaded, you see output like the following example in your function's streaming log:

```

## Environment variables
To get an environment variable or an app setting value, use `System.Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable`, as shown in the following code example:

```csharp
public static void Run(TimerInfo myTimer, TraceWriter log)
{
    log.Info($"C# Timer trigger function executed at: {DateTime.Now}");
    log.Info(GetEnvironmentVariable("AzureWebJobsStorage"));
    log.Info(GetEnvironmentVariable("WEBSITE_SITE_NAME"));
}

public static string GetEnvironmentVariable(string name)
{
    return name + ": " + 
        System.Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable(name, EnvironmentVariableTarget.Process);
}
```

## Reusing .csx code
You can use classes and methods defined in other *.csx* files in your *run.csx* file. To do that, use `#load` directives in your *run.csx* file, as shown in the following example.

Example *run.csx*:

```csharp
#load "mylogger.csx"

public static void Run(TimerInfo myTimer, TraceWriter log)
{
    log.Verbose($"Log by run.csx: {DateTime.Now}"); 
    MyLogger(log, $"Log by MyLogger: {DateTime.Now}");
}
```

Example *mylogger.csx*:

```csharp
public static void MyLogger(TraceWriter log, string logtext)
{
    log.Verbose(logtext); 
}
```

You can use a relative path with the `#load` directive:

* `#load "mylogger.csx"` loads a file located in the function folder.
* `#load "loadedfiles\mylogger.csx"` loads a file located in a folder in the function folder.
* `#load "..\shared\mylogger.csx"` loads a file located in a folder at the same level as the function folder, that is, directly under *wwwroot*.

The `#load` directive works only with *.csx* (C# script) files, not with *.cs* files.
