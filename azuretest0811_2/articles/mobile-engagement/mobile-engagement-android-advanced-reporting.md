# Reporting Options with Engagement on Android

This topic describes additional reporting scenarios in your Android application. These are options that you can choose to apply to the app created in the [Getting Started](mobile-engagement-android-get-started.md) tutorial.

## Prerequisites
[!INCLUDE [Prereqs](../../includes/mobile-engagement-android-prereqs.md)]

The tutorial you completed was deliberately direct and simple, but there are a number of options you can choose from.

## Modifying your `Activity` classes
In the [Getting Started tutorial](mobile-engagement-android-get-started.md), all you had to do was to make your `*Activity` sub-classes inherit from the corresponding `Engagement*Activity` classes (e.g. if your legacy activity extended `ListActivity`, you would make it extend `EngagementListActivity`).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When using `EngagementListActivity` or `EngagementExpandableListActivity`, make sure any call to `requestWindowFeature(...);` is made before the call to `super.onCreate(...);`, otherwise a crash will occur.
> 
> 

You can find these classes in the `src` folder, and can copy them into your project. The classes are also in the **JavaDoc**.

## Alternate method: call `startActivity()` and `endActivity()` manually
If you cannot or do not want to overload your `Activity` classes, you can instead start and end your activities by calling the `EngagementAgent`'s methods directly.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Android SDK never calls the `endActivity()` method, even when the application is closed (on Android, applications are actually never closed). Thus, it is *HIGHLY* recommended to call the `startActivity()` method in the `onResume` callback of *ALL* your activities, and the `endActivity()` method in the `onPause()` callback of *ALL* your activities. This is the only way to be sure that sessions will not be leaked. If a session is leaked, the Engagement service will never disconnect from the Engagement backend (since the service stays connected as long as a session is pending).

Here is an example:

    public class MyActivity extends Some3rdPartyActivity
    {
      @Override
      protected void onResume()
      {
        super.onResume();
        String activityNameOnEngagement = EngagementAgentUtils.buildEngagementActivityName(getClass()); // Uses short class name and removes "Activity" at the end.
        EngagementAgent.getInstance(this).startActivity(this, activityNameOnEngagement, null);
      }

      @Override
      protected void onPause()
      {
        super.onPause();
        EngagementAgent.getInstance(this).endActivity();
      }
    }

This example is very similiar to the `EngagementActivity` class and its variants, whose source code is provided in the `src` folder.

## Using Application.onCreate()
Any code you place in `Application.onCreate()` and in other application callbacks will be run for all your application's processes, including the Engagement service. It may have unwanted side effects, like unneeded memory allocations and threads in the Engagement's process, or duplicate broadcast receivers or services.

If you override `Application.onCreate()`, we recommend adding the following code snippet at the beginning of your `Application.onCreate()` function:

     public void onCreate()
     {
       if (EngagementAgentUtils.isInDedicatedEngagementProcess(this))
         return;

       ... Your code...
     }

You can do the same thing for `Application.onTerminate()`, `Application.onLowMemory()` and `Application.onConfigurationChanged(...)`.

You can also extend `EngagementApplication` instead of extending `Application`: the callback `Application.onCreate()` does the process check and calls `Application.onApplicationProcessCreate()` only if the current process is not the one hosting the Engagement service, the same rules apply for the other callbacks.

## Tags in the AndroidManifest.xml file
In the service tag in your AndroidManifest.xml file, the `android:label` attribute allows you to choose the name of the Engagement service as it will appear to the end-users in the "Running services" screen of their phone. We recommended setting this attribute to `"<Your application name>Service"` (e.g. `"AcmeFunGameService"`).

Specifying the `android:process` attribute ensures that the Engagement service will run in its own process (running Engagement in the same process as your application will make your main/UI thread potentially less responsive).

## Building with ProGuard
If you build your application package with ProGuard, you need to keep some classes. You can use the following configuration snippet:

    -keep public class * extends android.os.IInterface
    -keep class com.microsoft.azure.engagement.reach.activity.EngagementWebAnnouncementActivity$EngagementReachContentJS {
    <methods>;
     }
