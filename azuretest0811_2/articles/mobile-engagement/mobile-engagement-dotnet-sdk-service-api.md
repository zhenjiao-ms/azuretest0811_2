# Using .NET SDK to access Azure Mobile Engagement Service APIs
Azure Mobile Engagement exposes a set of APIs for you to manage Devices, Reach/Push campaigns etc. To interact with these APIs, we also provide you a [Swagger file](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/blob/master/arm-mobileengagement/2014-12-01/swagger/mobile-engagement.json) that you can use with tools to generate SDKs for your preferred language. We recommend using the [AutoRest](https://github.com/Azure/AutoRest) tool to generate your SDK from our Swagger file. 

We have created a .NET SDK in a similar manner which allows you to interact with these APIs using a C# wrapper and you don't have to do the authentication token negotiation and refresh yourself.  

This sample goes through the set of steps to follow to use the .NET SDK:

1. First of all, you need to setup the authentication for your APIs using the Azure Active Directory as described [here](mobile-engagement-api-authentication.md#authentication). At the end of these steps, you should have a valid **SubscriptionId**, **TenantId**, **ApplicationId** and **Secret**. 
2. We will use a simple Windows Console app to demonstrate working with the .NET SDK with the scenario of creating an Announcement campaign. So open up Visual Studio and create a **Console Application**.   
3. Next you need to download the .NET SDK which is available as **Microsoft Azure Engagement Management Library** in the Nuget gallery [here](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Management.Engagement/).
   If you are installing the Nuget from Visual Studio, you need to ensure that you have check marked the **Include prerelease** option while searching for the package:
   
    ![](./media/mobile-engagement-dotnet-sdk-service-api/include-prerelease.png)
4. In the `Program.cs` file, add the following namespaces:
   
        using Microsoft.Rest.Azure.Authentication;
        using Microsoft.Azure.Management.Engagement;
        using Microsoft.Azure.Management.Engagement.Models;
5. Next you need to define the following constants that we will use for authentication and interacting with the Mobile Engagement App in which you are creating the Announcement campaign:
   
        // For authentication
        const string TENANT_ID = "<Your TenantId>";
        const string CLIENT_ID = "<Your Application Id>";
        const string CLIENT_SECRET = "<Your Secret>";
        const string SUBSCRIPTION_ID = "<Your Subscription Id>";
   
        // This is the Azure Resource group concept for grouping together resources 
        //  see here: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/resource-group-portal/
        const string RESOURCE_GROUP = "";
   
        // For Mobile Engagement operations
        // App Collection Name 
        const string APP_COLLECTION_NAME = "";
        // Application Resource Name - make sure you are using the one as specified in the Azure portal (NOT the App Name)
        const string APP_RESOURCE_NAME = "";
6. Define the `EngagementManagementClient` variable which we will use to call the Mobile Engagement SDK methods:
   
        static EngagementManagementClient engagementClient; 
7. Add the following to your `Main` method:
   
        try
            {
                // Initialize the Engagement SDK to call out APIs. 
                InitEngagementClient().Wait();
   
                // Create a Reach campaign
                CreateCampaign().Wait();
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(ex.InnerException.Message);
                throw ex;
            }
8. Define the following method which takes care of initializing the `EngagementManagementClient` by first authenticating and then associating itself with the Mobile Engagement App in which you plan to create the Announcement campaign:
   
        private static async Task InitEngagementClient()
        {
            var credentials = await ApplicationTokenProvider.LoginSilentAsync(TENANT_ID, CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET);
            engagementClient = new EngagementManagementClient(credentials) { SubscriptionId = SUBSCRIPTION_ID };
   
            // This is the Azure concept of ResourceGroup
            engagementClient.ResourceGroupName = RESOURCE_GROUP;
   
            // This is your Mobile Engagement App Collection & App Resource Name in which you create the campaign
            engagementClient.AppCollection = APP_COLLECTION_NAME;
            engagementClient.AppName = APP_RESOURCE_NAME;
        }
   
   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Note that you need to use the **App Resource Name** as defined in the Azure management portal for the AppName parameter. 
   > 
9. Lastly, define the CreateCampaign method which will take care of using the previously initialized EngagementClient to create a simple **AnyTime** & **Notification-only** campaign with a title and message: 
   
        private async static Task CreateCampaign()
        {
            //  Refer to the Announcement Campaign format from here - 
            //      https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/mt683751.aspx
            // Make sure you are passing all the non-optional parameters
            Campaign parameters = new Campaign(
                name:"WelcomeCampaign",
                notificationTitle: "Welcome", 
                notificationMessage: "Thank you for installing the app!",
                type:"only_notif",
                deliveryTime:"any"
                );
   
            // Refer to the Campaign Kinds from here - https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/mt683742.aspx
            CampaignStateResult result = 
                await engagementClient.Campaigns.CreateAsync(CampaignKinds.Announcements, parameters);
            Console.WriteLine("Campaign Id '{0}' was created successfully and it is in '{1}' state", result.Id, result.State);
        }
10. Run the console app and you will see the following on successful creation of the campaign:
    
    **Campaign Id '159' was created successfully and it is in 'draft' state**
