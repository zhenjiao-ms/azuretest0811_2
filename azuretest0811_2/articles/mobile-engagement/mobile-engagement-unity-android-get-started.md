# Get Started with Azure Mobile Engagement for Unity Android deployment
[!INCLUDE [Hero tutorial switcher](../../includes/mobile-engagement-hero-tutorial-switcher.md)]

This topic shows you how to use Azure Mobile Engagement to understand your app usage and how to send push notifications to segmented users of a Unity application when deploying to an Android device.
This tutorial uses the classic Unity Roll a Ball tutorial as the starting point. You should follow the steps in this [tutorial](mobile-engagement-unity-roll-a-ball.md) before proceeding with the Mobile Engagement integration we showcase in the tutorial below. 

This tutorial requires the following:

* [Unity Editor](http://unity3d.com/get-unity)
* [Mobile Engagement Unity SDK](https://aka.ms/azmeunitysdk)
* Google Android SDK

> [!NOTE]
> To complete this tutorial, you must have an active Azure account. If you don't have an account, you can create a free trial account in just a couple of minutes. For details, see [Azure Free Trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/?WT.mc_id=A0E0E5C02&amp;returnurl=http%3A%2F%2Fazure.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fdocumentation%2Farticles%2Fmobile-engagement-unity-android-get-started).
