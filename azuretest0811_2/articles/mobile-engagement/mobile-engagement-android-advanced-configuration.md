# Advanced configuration for Azure Mobile Engagement Android SDK

This procedure describes how to configure various configuration options for Azure Mobile Engagement Android apps.

## Prerequisites
[!INCLUDE [Prereqs](../../includes/mobile-engagement-android-prereqs.md)]

## Permission Requirements
A number of options require specific permissions, all of which are listed here for reference, as well as in-line in the specific feature. Add these permissions to the AndroidManifest.xml of your project immediately before or after the `<application>` tag.

The permission code needs to look like the following, where you fill in the appropiate permission from the table below.

    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.[specific permission]"/>


| Permission | When used |
| --- | --- |
| INTERNET |Required. For basic reporting |
| ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE |Required. For basic reporting |
| RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED |Required. To show up the notifications center after device reboot |
| WAKE_LOCK |Strongly recommended. Enables collecting data when using WiFi or when screen is off |
| VIBRATE |Optional. Enables vibration when notifications are received |
| DOWNLOAD_WITHOUT_NOTIFICATION |Optional. Enables Android Big Picture Notification |
| WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE |Optional. Enables Android Big Picture Notification |
| ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION |Optional. Enables Real-time location reporting |
| ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION |Optional. Enables GPS-based location reporting |

Starting with Android M, [some permissions are managed at run time](mobile-engagement-android-location-reporting.md#Android-M-Permissions).

If you are already using ``ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`` then you don't need to also use ``ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION``.

## Android Manifest configuration options
### Crash report
If you want to disable crash reports, add this (between the `<application>` and `</application>` tags):

    <meta-data android:name="engagement:reportCrash" android:value="false"/>

### Burst threshold
By default, the Engagement service reports logs in real time. If your application reports logs very frequently, it is better to buffer the logs and to report them all at once on a regular time base (this is called the "burst mode"). To do so, add this code between the `<application>` and `</application>` tags:

    <meta-data android:name="engagement:burstThreshold" android:value="{interval between too bursts (in milliseconds)}"/>

The burst mode slightly increase the battery life but has an impact on the Engagement Monitor: all sessions and jobs duration will be rounded to the burst threshold (thus, sessions and jobs shorter than the burst threshold may not be visible). It is recommended to use a burst threshold no longer than 30000 (30s).

### Session timeout
By default, a session is ended 10s after the end of its last activity (which usually occurs by pressing the Home or Back key, by setting the phone idle or by jumping into another application). This is to avoid a session split each time the user exit and return to the application very quickly (which can happen when he pick up a image, check a notification, etc.). You may want to modify this parameter. To do so, add this (between the `<application>` and `</application>` tags):

    <meta-data android:name="engagement:sessionTimeout" android:value="{session timeout (in milliseconds)}"/>

## Disable log reporting
### Using a method call
If you want Engagement to stop sending logs, you can call:

    EngagementAgent.getInstance(context).setEnabled(false);

This call is persistent: it uses a shared preferences file.

If Engagement is active when you call this function, it may take 1 minute for the service to stop. However it won't launch the service at all the next time you launch the application.

You can enable log reporting again by calling the same function with `true`.

### Integration in your own `PreferenceActivity`
Instead of calling this function, you can also integrate this setting directly in your existing `PreferenceActivity`.

You can configure Engagement to use your preferences file (with the desired mode) in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file with `application meta-data`:

* The `engagement:agent:settings:name` key is used to define the name of the shared preferences file.
* The `engagement:agent:settings:mode` key is used to define the mode of the shared preferences file, you should use the same mode as in your `PreferenceActivity`. The mode must be passed as a number: if you are using a combination of constant flags in your code, check the total value.

Engagement always use the `engagement:key` boolean key within the preferences file for managing this setting.

The following example of `AndroidManifest.xml` shows the default values:

    <application>
        [...]
        <meta-data
          android:name="engagement:agent:settings:name"
          android:value="engagement.agent" />
        <meta-data
          android:name="engagement:agent:settings:mode"
          android:value="0" />

Then you can add a `CheckBoxPreference` in your preference layout like the following one:

    <CheckBoxPreference
      android:key="engagement:enabled"
      android:defaultValue="true"
      android:title="Use Engagement"
      android:summaryOn="Engagement is enabled."
      android:summaryOff="Engagement is disabled." />
