# Indexing CSV blobs with Azure Search blob indexer
By default, [Azure Search blob indexer](search-howto-indexing-azure-blob-storage.md) parses delimited text blobs as a single chunk of text. However, with blobs containing CSV data, you often want to treat each line in the blob as a separate document. For example, given the following delimited text: 

    id, datePublished, tags
    1, 2016-01-12, "azure-search,azure,cloud" 
    2, 2016-07-07, "cloud,mobile" 

you might want to parse it into 2 documents, each containing "id", "datePublished", and "tags" fields.

In this article you will learn how to parse CSV blobs with an Azure Search blob indexer. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This functionality is currently in preview. It is available only in the REST API using version **2015-02-28-Preview**. Please remember, preview APIs are intended for testing and evaluation, and should not be used in production environments.

## Setting up CSV indexing
To index CSV blobs, create or update an indexer definition with the `delimitedText` parsing mode:  

    {
      "name" : "my-csv-indexer",
      ... other indexer properties
      "parameters" : { "configuration" : { "parsingMode" : "delimitedText", "firstLineContainsHeaders" : true } }
    }

For more details on the Create Indexer API, check out [Create Indexer](search-api-indexers-2015-02-28-preview.md#create-indexer).

`firstLineContainsHeaders` indicates that the first (non-blank) line of each blob contains headers.
If blobs don't contain an initial header line, the headers should be specified in the indexer configuration: 

    "parameters" : { "configuration" : { "parsingMode" : "delimitedText", "delimitedTextHeaders" : "id,datePublished,tags" } } 

Currently, only the UTF-8 encoding is supported. Also, only the comma `','` character is supported as the delimiter. If you need support for other encodings or delimiters, please let us know on [our UserVoice site](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/263029-azure-search).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you use the delimited text parsing mode, Azure Search assumes that all blobs in your data source will be CSV. If you need to support a mix of CSV and non-CSV blobs in the same data source, please let us know on [our UserVoice site](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/263029-azure-search).
