## How features are versioned and rolled out
Features are released separately or jointly through the [REST API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn798935.aspx), [.NET SDK](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=528216), or the service dashboard in the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com). Both the .NET library and REST APIs have multiple versions. Older APIs remain operational as we roll out new features. You can visit [Search service versioning](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn864560.aspx) to learn more about our versioning policy.

Preview and generally available (GA) features are tied to an API version of the same category.

* Preview features are experimental and could change or even be abandoned before graduating to GA. Preview features are always available in the [preview version of the REST API](search-api-2015-02-28-preview.md), and sometimes in the [.NET SDK](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=528216). Feature documentation will always explain how to access the feature in question.
* GA features are stable and unlikely to change. Any change to a GA feature is announced as a breaking change.

Features that are purely portal or tool-based are expected to change over time and are not classified as either preview or GA.
