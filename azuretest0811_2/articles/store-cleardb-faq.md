# FAQ for ClearDB MySql databases with Azure App Service
This FAQ answers common questions about using and purchasing ClearDB MySQL databases for Azure Web Apps.

## What options do I have for MySQL on Azure?
You have several options:

* [ClearDB Shared MySQL database](/marketplace/partners/cleardb/databases/)
* [ClearDB MySQL Premium clusters](/marketplace/partners/cleardb-clusters/cluster/)
* [MySQL cluster running on an Azure VM](https://github.com/azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/mysql-replication)
* [Single instance of MySQL running on an Azure VM](virtual-machines/virtual-machines-windows-classic-mysql-2008r2.md)

ClearDB is a MySQL hosting service and manages the MySQL infrastructure for you. When you run your own MySQL cluster or database on an Azure Virtual Machine you have to set up the MySQL server and keep it updated with patches.

## Do I need a credit card for the Web app + MySQL template in the Azure Marketplace?
This depends on the type of subscription you are using. Here are some commonly used subscription types:

* [Pay as you Go](/offers/ms-azr-0003p/): Requires a credit card, and when you purchase a paid MySQL database your credit card will be charged.
* [Free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/): Includes credits for use with Microsoft Azure services but doesn't allow purchase of third party resources. To purchase third party services or a paid MySQL database you need to use a credit card enabled subscription. For Web Apps you can create a FREE ClearDB MySQL database.
* [MSDN subscription](/pricing/member-offers/msdn-benefits/) and **MSDN Dev Test Pay as you go**: Similar to Free trial, an MSDN subscription requires you to have a credit card to purchase a paid MySQL solution from ClearDB.
* [Enterprise Agreement (EA)](/pricing/enterprise-agreement/): EA customers are billed against their EA each quarter for all of their Azure Marketplace (third party) purchases on a separate, consolidated invoice. You will be billed outside the monetary commitment for any marketplace purchases. Please note that, at this time, Azure Store is not available to customers enrolled in Azerbaijan, Croatia, Norway and Puerto Rico. 
* [DreamSpark](https://www.dreamspark.com/Product/Product.aspx?productid=99): You can create only FREE ClearDB databases for Web Apps. There is no limit on the number of Free ClearDB MySQL databases you can create. Note that Free databases are not to be used for production web apps, as this service is intended only for trial.

## Why was I charged $3.50 for a Web app + MySQL from the Azure Marketplace?
The default database option is Titan, which is $3.50. We don’t show the cost during database creation, and you may mistakenly purchase a database you didn’t intend to.  We are trying to find a way to improve the experience but until then you must check all your selected pricing tiers for web app and database before clicking **Create** and starting the deployment of the resources.

## I am running MySQL on my own Azure virtual machine. Can I connect my Azure web app to my database?
Yes. You can connect your web app to your database as long as your Azure VM has given remote access to your web app. For more information, see [Install MySQL on a virtual machine](virtual-machines/virtual-machines-windows-classic-mysql-2008r2.md).

## In which countries are ClearDB Premium MySQL clusters supported?
[ClearDB Premium MySQL clusters](/marketplace/partners/cleardb-clusters/cluster/) are available in all Azure regions worldwide with the exception of India, Australia, Brazil South, and China.

## Can I create a new cluster prior to creating a database with ClearDB premium cluster solution?
No, creating empty ClearDB clusters is not supported. The Azure Portal allows you to create databases in a cluster, which may create a new cluster at the same time.

## Will I be warned if I try to delete a ClearDB MySQL database that is in use by one of my applications?
No, Azure will not warn you if you delete a marketplace purchase that your application depends on.

## Which regions can I create ClearDB databases in?
Azure Marketplace is not available to customers enrolled in Azerbaijan, Croatia, Norway or Puerto Rico. ClearDB is not available in these regions.

## What pricing tier should I choose for a production web app and database?
Use Basic or a higher pricing tier for Web Apps. For ClearDB, we recommend either a Saturn or Jupiter plan. Review the features & limitations of each pricing tier for both [Web Apps](/pricing/details/app-service/) and [ClearDB MySQL databases](/marketplace/partners/cleardb/databases/) to choose the one that fits your needs.

## How do I upgrade my ClearDB database from one plan to another?
You can use the [ClearDB Upgrade Wizard](https://www.cleardb.com/store/azure/upgrade). Currently we don’t have an upgrade path in the Azure portal.

## I can’t see my ClearDB database in Azure portal ?
If we create ClearDB database using Azure resource Manager or [new azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) , it will not be visible in the [old azure portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com). To workaround this is to link your database manually to the web app. Similarly if create ClearDB database in the [old portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com) you will not be able to see your database in the [new azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).There is no workaround for the latter scenario.

## Who do I contact for support when my database is down?
Contact [ClearDB support](https://www.cleardb.com/developers/help/support) for any database related issues. Be prepared to provide them with your Azure subscription information.

## Can I create additional users for my ClearDB MySQL database cluster solution?
No. You cannot create additional users but you can create additional databases on your ClearDB database cluster.   

## Can Basic/Pro series databases be upgraded in-place similar to Planetary plans today on ClearDB portal?
Yes, Basic series databases can be upgraded in-place (Basic 60 through Basic 500). Pro series can be upgraded in-place (Pro 125 through Pro 1000) with the exception of Pro 60. We do not support upgrading Pro 60 database currently. 

## When I migrate my resources from one subscription to another, does my ClearDB MySQL database get migrated as well?
When you perform resource migration across subscriptions, some [limitations](app-service-web/app-service-move-resources.md) apply. A ClearDB MySQL database is a third party service and hence does not get migrated during Azure subscription migration. If you do not manage the migration of your MySQL database prior to migrating Azure resources, your ClearDB MySQL databases can be disabled. Manually migrate your databases first and then perform Azure subscription migration for your web app. 

## Can I purchase Scalable WordPress with an Enterprise Agreement (EA) subscription?
The process is the same for any subscription. Go to Azure Marketplace in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), and select [Scalable WordPress](https://portal.azure.com/?feature.customportal=false#create/WordPress.ScalableWordPress) to start creating the app. Scalable WordPress only supports ClearDB Saturn and Jupiter pricing tiers, and your EA credits will go towards both your web application running on the Standard Web Apps pricing tier and the paid ClearDB (shared) MySQL database.[/marketplace/faq/](/marketplace/faq/)  You will be billed against your EA each quarter for all Store purchases on a separate, consolidated invoice.

## Can I transfer a ClearDB database from a credit card subscription to an EA subscription?
Existing ClearDB databases will use the credit card associated with the existing subscriptions. To use an EA subscription you need to migrate your data to a new database:

* Purchase a new ClearDB database with your EA subscription.
* Migrate your data to your new database.
* Update your application to use the new database.
* Delete your old ClearDB database.

When you create a new web app with MySQL (ClearDB) or create a MySQL database (ClearDB), the subscription you choose determines how you will pay for the service. Note that with an EA subscription, we will not block the procurement of the third party services such as ClearDB in the Azure portal. EA subscriptions are billed outside of Monetary Commitment and are billed quarterly and in arrears. The EA customer would have to set up a payment method such as a credit card to pay for any third party marketplace services.

## Where can I see the charges for ClearDB resources in an EA subscription?
For Direct EA customers, Azure Marketplace charges are visible on the Enterprise Portal. Note that all marketplace purchases and consumption are billed outside of Monetary Commitment and are billed quarterly and in arrears. EA customers have to pay directly to the third party service providers and can do so by enabling a payment method such as a credit card with their EA account.

Indirect EA customers can find their Azure Marketplace subscriptions on the **Manage Subscriptions** page of the Enterprise Portal, but pricing is hidden. Customers should contact their LSP for information on marketplace charges.

Access to Azure Marketplace for third party services can be managed by your EA Azure enrollment administrators. They can disable or re-enable access to 3rd party purchases from the Store in Manage Accounts and Subscriptions under the Accounts section in the Enterprise Portal.

## Who do I contact for questions about my bill for ClearDB services in my EA subscription?
Contact [Enterprise Customer Support](http://aka.ms/AzureEntSupport) with regards to billing under their EA enrollment. The EA Portal Support Team will answer your question or help resolve your issue.
