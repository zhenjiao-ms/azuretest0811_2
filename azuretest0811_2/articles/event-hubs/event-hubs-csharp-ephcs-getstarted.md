# Get started with Event Hubs
[!INCLUDE [service-bus-selector-get-started](../../includes/service-bus-selector-get-started.md)]

## Introduction
Event Hubs is a service that processes large amounts of event data (telemetry) from connected devices and applications. After you collect data into Event Hubs, you can store the data using a storage cluster or transform it using a real-time analytics provider. This large scale event collection and processing capability is a key component of modern application architectures including the Internet of Things (IoT).

This tutorial shows how to use the Azure classic portal to create an Event Hub. It also shows you how to collect messages into an Event Hub using a console application written in C#, and how to retrieve them in parallel using the C# [Event Processor Host](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.ServiceBus.EventProcessorHost) library.

In order to complete this tutorial you'll need the following:

* [Microsoft Visual Studio](http://visualstudio.com)
* An active Azure account. <br/>If you don't have one, you can create a free account in just a couple of minutes. For details, see [Azure Free Trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/?WT.mc_id=A0E0E5C02&amp;returnurl=http%3A%2F%2Fazure.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fdevelop%2Fmobile%2Ftutorials%2Fget-started%2F target="_blank").

[!INCLUDE [event-hubs-create-event-hub](../../includes/event-hubs-create-event-hub.md)]

[!INCLUDE [service-bus-event-hubs-get-started-send-csharp](../../includes/service-bus-event-hubs-get-started-send-csharp.md)]

[!INCLUDE [service-bus-event-hubs-get-started-receive-ephcs](../../includes/service-bus-event-hubs-get-started-receive-ephcs.md)]

## Run the applications
Now you are ready to run the applications.

1. From within Visual Studio, open the **Receiver** project you created earlier.
2. Right-click the **Receiver** solution, then click **Add**, and then click **Existing Project**.
3. Locate the existing Sender.csproj file, then double-click it to add it to the solution.
4. Again, right-click the **Receiver** solution and then click **Properties**. The **Receiver** property page is displayed.
5. Click **Startup Project**, then click the **Multiple startup projects** button. Set the **Action** box for both the **Receiver** and **Sender** projects to **Start**.

6. Click **Project Dependencies**. In the **Projects** box, click **Sender**. In the **Depends on** box, make sure **Receiver** is checked.

7. Click **OK** to dismiss the **Properties** dialog.
8. Press F5 to run the **Receiver** project from within Visual Studio, then wait for it to start the receivers for all the partitions.

9. The **Sender** project will run automatically. Press **Enter** in the console window, and see the events appear in the receiver window.

Press **Ctrl+C** in the **Sender** window to end the Sender application, then press **Enter** in the Receiver window to shut down that application.

## Next steps
Now that you've built a working application that creates an Event Hub and sends and receives data, you can move on to the following scenarios:

* A complete [sample application that uses Event Hubs](https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/Service-Bus-Event-Hub-286fd097).
* The [Scale out Event Processing with Event Hubs](https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/Service-Bus-Event-Hub-45f43fc3) sample.
* A [queued messaging solution](../service-bus/service-bus-dotnet-multi-tier-app-using-service-bus-queues.md) using Service Bus queues.
