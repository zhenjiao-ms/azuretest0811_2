# Ingest telemetry and application events at scale
Modern applications produce a large amount of information while they are running. Whether user actions in a mobile app or clickstreams on a website, this telemetry data is valuable for both long-term analytics and real-time health monitoring or decision support. Microsoft Azure Event Hubs provides the tools you need to capture and process this information.
