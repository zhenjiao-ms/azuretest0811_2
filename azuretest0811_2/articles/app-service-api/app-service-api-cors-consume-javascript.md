# Consume an API app from JavaScript using CORS
App Service offers built-in support for [Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing), which enables JavaScript clients to make cross-domain calls to APIs that are hosted in API apps. App Service lets you configure CORS access to your API without writing any code in your API.

This article contains two sections:

* The [How to configure CORS](#corsconfig) section explains in general how to configure CORS for any API app, web app, or mobile app. It applies equally to all frameworks that are supported by App Service, including .NET, Node.js, and Java. 
* Starting with the [Continuing the .NET getting-started tutorials](#tutorialstart) section, the article is a tutorial that demonstrates CORS support by building on what you did in [the first API Apps getting started tutorial](app-service-api-dotnet-get-started.md). 

## <a id="corsconfig"></a> How to configure CORS in Azure App Service
You can configure CORS in the Azure portal or by using [Azure Resource Manager](../resource-group-overview.md) tools.

#### Configure CORS in the Azure portal
1. In a browser go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
2. Click **App Services**, and then click the name of your API app.
   
    ![Select API app in portal](./media/app-service-api-cors-consume-javascript/browseapiapps.png)
3. In the **Settings** blade that opens to the right of the **API app** blade, find the **API** section, and then click **CORS**.
   
   ![Select CORS in Settings blade](./media/app-service-api-cors-consume-javascript/clicksettings.png)
4. In the text box enter the URL or URLs that you want to allow JavaScript calls to come from.

    For example, if you deployed your JavaScript application to a web app named todolistangular, enter "https://todolistangular.azurewebsites.net". As an alternative, you can enter an asterisk (*) to specify that all origin domains are accepted.


1. Click **Save**.
   
   ![Click Save](./media/app-service-api-cors-consume-javascript/corsinportal.png)
   
   After you click **Save**, the API app will accept JavaScript calls from the specified URLs.

#### Configure CORS by using Azure Resource Manager tools
You can also configure CORS for an API app by using [Azure Resource Manager templates](../resource-group-authoring-templates.md) in command line tools such as [Azure PowerShell](../powershell-install-configure.md) and the [Azure CLI](../xplat-cli-install.md). 

For an example of an Azure Resource Manager template that sets the CORS property, open the [azuredeploy.json file in the repository for this tutorial's sample application](https://github.com/azure-samples/app-service-api-dotnet-todo-list/blob/master/azuredeploy.json). Find the section of the template that looks like the following example:

        "cors": {
            "allowedOrigins": [
                "todolistangular.azurewebsites.net"
            ]
        }

## <a id="tutorialstart"></a> Continuing the .NET getting-started tutorial
If you are following the Node.js or Java getting-started series for API apps, you have completed the getting started series. Skip to the [Next steps](#next-steps) section to find suggestions for further learning about API Apps.

The remainder of this article is a continuation of the .NET getting-started series and assumes that you successfully completed [the first tutorial](app-service-api-dotnet-get-started.md).

## Deploy the ToDoListAngular project to a new web app
In [the first tutorial](app-service-api-dotnet-get-started.md), you created a middle tier API app and a data tier API app. In this tutorial you create a single-page application (SPA) web app that calls the middle tier API app. For the SPA to work you have to enable CORS on the middle tier API app. 

In the [ToDoList sample application](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/app-service-api-dotnet-todo-list), the ToDoListAngular project is a simple AngularJS client that calls the middle tier ToDoListAPI Web API project. The JavaScript code in the *app/scripts/todoListSvc.js* file calls the API by using the AngularJS HTTP provider. 

        angular.module('todoApp')
        .factory('todoListSvc', ['$http', function ($http) {

            $http.defaults.useXDomain = true;
            delete $http.defaults.headers.common['X-Requested-With']; 

            return {
                getItems : function(){
                    return $http.get(apiEndpoint + '/api/TodoList');
                },

                /* Get by ID, Put, and Delete methods not shown */

                postItem : function(item){
                    return $http.post(apiEndpoint + '/api/TodoList', item);
                }
            };
        }]);

### Create a new web app for the ToDoListAngular project
The procedure to create a new App Service web app and deploy a project to it is similar to what you saw for [creating and deploying an API app in the first tutorial in this series](app-service-api-dotnet-get-started.md#createapiapp). The only difference is that the app type is **Web App** instead of **API App**.  For screen shots of the dialogs, see 

1. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the ToDoListAngular project, and then click **Publish**.
2. In the **Profile** tab of the **Publish Web** wizard, click **Microsoft Azure App Service**.
3. In the **App Service** dialog box, click **New**.
4. In the **Hosting** tab of the **Create App Service** dialog box, enter a **Web App Name** that is unique in the *azurewebsites.net* domain. 
5. Choose the Azure **Subscription** you want to work with.
6. In the **Resource Group** drop-down list, choose the same resource group you created earlier.
7. In the **App Service Plan** drop-down list, choose the same plan you created earlier. 
8. Click **Create**.
   
    Visual Studio creates the web app, creates a publish profile for it, and displays the **Connection** step of the **Publish Web** wizard.
   
    Don't click **Publish** yet. In the following section, you configure the new web app to call the middle tier API app that is running in App Service. 

### Set the middle tier URL in web app settings
1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), and then navigate to the **Web App** blade for the web app that you created to host the TodoListAngular (front end) project.
2. Click **Settings > Application Settings**.
3. In the **App settings** section, add the following key and value:
   
   | Key | Value | Example |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | toDoListAPIURL |https://{your middle tier API app name}.azurewebsites.net |https://todolistapi0121.azurewebsites.net |
4. Click **Save**.
   
    When the code runs in Azure, this value overrides the localhost URL that is in the *Web.config* file. 
   
    The code that gets the setting value is in *index.cshtml*:
   
        <script type="text/javascript">
            var apiEndpoint = "@System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["toDoListAPIURL"]";
        </script>
        <script src="app/scripts/todoListSvc.js"></script>
   
    The code in *todoListSvc.js* uses the setting:
   
        return {
            getItems : function(){
                return $http.get(apiEndpoint + '/api/TodoList');
            },
            getItem : function(id){
                return $http.get(apiEndpoint + '/api/TodoList/' + id);
            },
            postItem : function(item){
                return $http.post(apiEndpoint + '/api/TodoList', item);
            },
            putItem : function(item){
                return $http.put(apiEndpoint + '/api/TodoList/', item);
            },
            deleteItem : function(id){
                return $http({
                    method: 'DELETE',
                    url: apiEndpoint + '/api/TodoList/' + id
                });
            }
        };

### Deploy the ToDoListAngular web project to the new web app
* In Visual Studio, in the **Connection** step of the **Publish Web** wizard, click **Publish**.
  
   Visual Studio deploys the ToDoListAngular project to the new web app and opens a browser to the URL of the web app. 

### Test the application without CORS enabled
1. In your browser Developer Tools, open the Console window.
2. In the browser window that displays the AngularJS UI, click the **To Do List** link.
   
    The JavaScript code tries to call the middle tier API app, but the call fails because the front end is running in a different domain than the back end. The browser's Developer Tools Console window shows a cross-origin error message.
   
    ![Cross-origin error message](./media/app-service-api-cors-consume-javascript/consoleaccessdenied.png)

## Configure CORS for the middle tier API app
In this section, you configure the CORS setting in Azure for the middle tier ToDoListAPI API app. This setting will allow the middle tier API app to receive JavaScript calls from the web app that you created for the ToDoListAngular project.

1. In a browser, go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
2. Click **App Services**, and then click the ToDoListAPI (middle tier) API app.
   
    ![Select API app in portal](./media/app-service-api-cors-consume-javascript/browseapiapps.png)
3. In the **Settings** blade that opens to the right of the **API app** blade, find the **API** section, and then click **CORS**.
   
   ![Select CORS in portal](./media/app-service-api-cors-consume-javascript/clicksettings.png)
4. In the text box, enter the URL for the ToDoListAngular (front end) web app. For example, if you deployed the ToDoListAngular project to a web app named todolistangular0121, allow calls from the URL `https://todolistangular0121.azurewebsites.net`.
   
   As an alternative, you can enter an asterisk (*) to specify that all origin domains are accepted.
5. Click **Save**.
   
   ![Click Save](./media/app-service-api-cors-consume-javascript/corsinportal.png)
   
   After you click **Save**, the API app will accept JavaScript calls from the specified URL. In this screen shot, the ToDoListAPI0223 API app will accept JavaScript client calls from the ToDoListAngular web app.

### Test the application with CORS enabled
* Open a browser to the HTTPS URL of the web app. 
  
    This time the application lets you view, add, edit, and delete to-do items. 
  
    ![To Do List page of sample app](./media/app-service-api-cors-consume-javascript/corssuccess.png)

## App Service CORS versus Web API CORS
In a Web API project, you can install the [Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi.Cors](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi.Cors/) NuGet package to specify in code which domains your API will accept JavaScript calls from.

Web API CORS support is more flexible than App Service CORS support. For example, in code you can specify different accepted origins for different action methods, while for App Service CORS you specify one set of accepted origins for all of an API app's methods.

> [!NOTE]
> Don't try to use both Web API CORS and App Service CORS in one API app. App Service CORS will take precedence and Web API CORS will have no effect. For example, if you enable one origin domain in App Service, and enable all origin domains in your Web API code, your Azure API app will only accept calls from the domain you specified in Azure.

### How to enable CORS in Web API code
The following steps summarize the process for enabling Web API CORS support. For more information, see [Enabling Cross-Origin Requests in ASP.NET Web API 2](http://www.asp.net/web-api/overview/security/enabling-cross-origin-requests-in-web-api).

1. In a Web API project, install the [Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi.Cors](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi.Cors/) NuGet package.
2. Include a `config.EnableCors()` line of code in the **Register** method of the **WebApiConfig** class, as in the following example. 
   
        public static class WebApiConfig
        {
            public static void Register(HttpConfiguration config)
            {
                // Web API configuration and services
   
                // The following line enables you to control CORS by using Web API code
                config.EnableCors();
   
                // Web API routes
                config.MapHttpAttributeRoutes();
   
                config.Routes.MapHttpRoute(
                    name: "DefaultApi",
                    routeTemplate: "api/{controller}/{id}",
                    defaults: new { id = RouteParameter.Optional }
                );
            }
        }
3. In your Web API controller, add a `using` statement for the `System.Web.Http.Cors` namespace, and add the `EnableCors` attribute to the controller class or to individual action methods. In the following example, CORS support applies to the entire controller.
   
        namespace ToDoListAPI.Controllers 
        {
            [HttpOperationExceptionFilterAttribute]
            [EnableCors(origins:"https://todolistangular0121.azurewebsites.net", headers:"accept,content-type,origin,x-my-header", methods: "get,post")]
            public class ToDoListController : ApiController

## Using Azure API Management with API Apps
If you use Azure API Management with an API app, configure CORS in API Management instead of in the API app. For more information, see the following resources:

* [Azure API Management Overview (video: CORS starts at 12:10)](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/videos/azure-api-management-overview/)
* [API Management cross domain policies](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn894084.aspx#CORS)

## Troubleshooting
In case you run into a problem while going through this tutorial, here are some troubleshooting ideas.

* Make sure that you're using the latest version of the [Azure SDK for .NET for Visual Studio 2015](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=518003).
* Make sure that you entered `https` in the CORS setting, and make sure that you're using `https` to run the front-end web app.
* Make sure that you entered the CORS setting in the middle tier API app, not in the front-end web app.
* If you're configuring CORS in both application code and Azure App Service, note that the App Service CORS setting will override whatever you're doing in application code.
