You can view the operations for a deployment through the Azure PowerShell. You may be most interested in viewing the operations when you have received an error during deployment so this article focuses on viewing operations that have failed. PowerShell provides cmdlets that enable you to easily find the errors and determine potential fixes.

[!INCLUDE [resource-manager-troubleshoot-introduction](../includes/resource-manager-troubleshoot-introduction.md)]

You can avoid some errors by validating your template and infrastructure prior to deployment. You can also log additional request and response information during deployment that may be helpful later for troubleshooting. To learn about validating, and logging request and response information, see [Deploy a resource group with Azure Resource Manager template](resource-group-template-deploy.md).

## Use deployment operations to troubleshoot
1. To get the overall status of a deployment, use the **Get-AzureRmResourceGroupDeployment** command. You can filter the results for only those deployments that have failed.
   
        Get-AzureRmResourceGroupDeployment -ResourceGroupName ExampleGroup | Where-Object ProvisioningState -eq Failed
   
    Which returns the failed deployments in the following format:
   
        DeploymentName          : Microsoft.Template
        ResourceGroupName       : ExampleGroup
        ProvisioningState       : Failed
        Timestamp               : 6/14/2016 9:55:21 PM
        Mode                    : Incremental
        TemplateLink            :
        Parameters              :
                    Name                Type                 Value
                    ===============     ===================  ==========
                    storageAccountName  String               tfstorage9855
                    adminUsername       String               tfadmin
                    adminPassword       SecureString
                    dnsNameforLBIP      String               dns
                    vmNamePrefix        String               myVM
                    imagePublisher      String               MicrosoftWindowsServer
                    imageOffer          String               WindowsServer
                    imageSKU            String               2012-R2-Datacenter
                    lbName              String               myLB
                    nicNamePrefix       String               nic
                    publicIPAddressName String               myPublicIP
                    vnetName            String               myVNET
                    vmSize              String               Standard_D1
   
        Outputs                 :
        DeploymentDebugLogLevel :
2. Each deployment is usually made up of multiple operations, with each operation representing a step in the deployment process. To discover what went wrong with a deployment, you usually need to see details about the deployment operations. You can see the status of the operations with **Get-AzureRmResourceGroupDeploymentOperation**.
   
        Get-AzureRmResourceGroupDeploymentOperation -ResourceGroupName ExampleGroup -DeploymentName Microsoft.Template
   
    Which returns multiple operations with each one in the following format:
   
        Id             : /subscriptions/{guid}/resourceGroups/ExampleGroup/providers/Microsoft.Resources/deployments/Microsoft.Template/operations/A3EB2DA598E0A780
        OperationId    : A3EB2DA598E0A780
        Properties     : @{provisioningOperation=Create; provisioningState=Succeeded; timestamp=2016-06-14T21:55:15.0156208Z;
                         duration=PT23.0227078S; trackingId=11d376e8-5d6d-4da8-847e-6f23c6443fbf;
                         serviceRequestId=0196828d-8559-4bf6-b6b8-8b9057cb0e23; statusCode=OK; targetResource=}
        PropertiesText : {duration:PT23.0227078S, provisioningOperation:Create, provisioningState:Succeeded,
                         serviceRequestId:0196828d-8559-4bf6-b6b8-8b9057cb0e23...}
3. To get more details about failed operations, retrieve the properties for operations with **Failed** state.
   
        (Get-AzureRmResourceGroupDeploymentOperation -DeploymentName Microsoft.Template -ResourceGroupName ExampleGroup).Properties | Where-Object ProvisioningState -eq Failed
   
    Which returns all of the failed operations with each one in the following format:
   
        provisioningOperation : Create
        provisioningState     : Failed
        timestamp             : 2016-06-14T21:54:55.1468068Z
        duration              : PT3.1449887S
        trackingId            : f4ed72f8-4203-43dc-958a-15d041e8c233
        serviceRequestId      : a426f689-5d5a-448d-a2f0-9784d14c900a
        statusCode            : BadRequest
        statusMessage         : @{error=}
        targetResource        : @{id=/subscriptions/{guid}/resourceGroups/ExampleGroup/providers/
                                Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses/myPublicIP;
                                resourceType=Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses; resourceName=myPublicIP}
   
    Note the tracking ID for the operation. You will use that in the next step to focus on a particular operation.
4. To get the status message of a particular failed operation, use the following command:
   
        ((Get-AzureRmResourceGroupDeploymentOperation -DeploymentName Microsoft.Template -ResourceGroupName ExampleGroup).Properties | Where-Object trackingId -eq f4ed72f8-4203-43dc-958a-15d041e8c233).StatusMessage.error
   
    Which returns:
   
        code           message                                                                        details
        ----           -------                                                                        -------
        DnsRecordInUse DNS record dns.westus.cloudapp.azure.com is already used by another public IP. {}

## Use audit logs to troubleshoot
[!INCLUDE [resource-manager-audit-limitations](../includes/resource-manager-audit-limitations.md)]

To see errors for a deployment, use the following steps:

1. To retrieve log entries, run the **Get-AzureRmLog** command. You can use the **ResourceGroup** and **Status** parameters to return only events that failed for a single resource group. If you do not specify a start and end time, entries for the last hour are returned.
   For example, to retrieve the failed operations for the past hour run:
   
        Get-AzureRmLog -ResourceGroup ExampleGroup -Status Failed
   
    You can specify a particular timespan. In the next example, we'll look for failed actions for the last day. 
   
        Get-AzureRmLog -ResourceGroup ExampleGroup -StartTime (Get-Date).AddDays(-1) -Status Failed
   
    Or, you can set an exact start and end time for failed actions:
   
        Get-AzureRmLog -ResourceGroup ExampleGroup -StartTime 2015-08-28T06:00 -EndTime 2015-09-10T06:00 -Status Failed
2. If this command returns too many entries and properties, you can focus your auditing efforts by retrieving the **Properties** property. We'll also include the **DetailedOutput** parameter to see the error messages.
   
        (Get-AzureRmLog -Status Failed -ResourceGroup ExampleGroup -StartTime (Get-Date).AddDays(-1) -DetailedOutput).Properties
   
    Which returns properties of the log entries in the following format:
   
        Content
        -------
        {} 
        {[statusCode, BadRequest], [statusMessage, {"error":{"code":"DnsRecordInUse","message":"DNS record dns.westus.clouda...
        {[statusCode, BadRequest], [serviceRequestId, a426f689-5d5a-448d-a2f0-9784d14c900a], [statusMessage, {"error":{"code...
3. Based on these results, let's focus on the second element. You can further refine the results by looking at the status message for that entry.
   
        ((Get-AzureRmLog -Status Failed -ResourceGroup ExampleGroup -DetailedOutput -StartTime (Get-Date).AddDays(-1)).Properties[1].Content["statusMessage"] | ConvertFrom-Json).error
   
    Which returns:
   
        code           message                                                                        details
        ----           -------                                                                        -------
        DnsRecordInUse DNS record dns.westus.cloudapp.azure.com is already used by another public IP. {}
