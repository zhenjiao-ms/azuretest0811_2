# Limitations for Stretch Database
Learn about limitations for Stretch\-enabled tables, and about limitations that currently prevent you from enabling Stretch for a table.

## <a name="Caveats"></a> Limitations for Stretch\-enabled tables
Stretch\-enabled tables have the following limitations.

### Constraints
* Uniqueness is not enforced for UNIQUE constraints and PRIMARY KEY constraints in the Azure table that contains the migrated data.

### DML operations
* You can't UPDATE or DELETE rows that have been migrated, or rows that are eligible for migration, in a Stretch\-enabled table or in a view that includes Stretch\-enabled tables.
* You can't INSERT rows into a Stretch\-enabled table on a linked server.

### Indexes
* You can't create an index for a view that includes Stretch\-enabled tables.
* Filters on SQL Server indexes are not propagated to the remote table.

## <a name="Limitations"></a> Limitations that currently prevent you from enabling Stretch for a table
The following items currently prevent you from enabling Stretch for a table.

### Table properties
* Tables that have more than 1,023 columns or more than 998 indexes
* FileTables or tables that contain FILESTREAM data
* Tables that are replicated, or that are actively using Change Tracking or Change Data Capture
* Memory\-optimized tables

### Data types
* text, ntext and image
* timestamp
* sql\_variant
* XML
* CLR data types including geometry, geography, hierarchyid, and CLR user\-defined types

### Column types
* COLUMN\_SET
* Computed columns

### Constraints
* Default constraints and check constraints
* Foreign key constraints that reference the table. In a parent\-child relationship \(for example, Order and Order\_Detail\), you can enable Stretch for the child table \(Order\_Detail\) but not for the parent table \(Order\).

### Indexes
* Full text indexes
* XML indexes
* Spatial indexes
* Indexed views that reference the table
