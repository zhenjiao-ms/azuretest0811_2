# Disable Stretch Database and bring back remote data
To disable Stretch Database for a table, select **Stretch** for a table in SQL Server Management Studio. Then select one of the following options.

* **Disable | Bring data back from Azure**. Copy the remote data for the table from Azure back to SQL Server, then disable Stretch Database for the table. This operation incurs data transfer costs, and it can't be canceled.
* **Disable | Leave data in Azure**. Disable Stretch Database for the table.  Abandon the remote data for the table in Azure.

You can also use Transact\-SQL to disable Stretch Database for a table or for a database.

After you disable Stretch Database for a table, data migration stops and query results no longer include results from the remote table.

If you simply want to pause data migration, see [Pause and resume Stretch Database](sql-server-stretch-database-pause.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Disabling Stretch Database for a table or for a database does not delete the remote object. If you want to delete the remote table or the remote database, you have to drop it by using the Azure management portal. The remote objects continue to incur Azure storage costs until you delete them. For more info, see [SQL Server Stretch Database Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/sql-server-stretch-database/).
