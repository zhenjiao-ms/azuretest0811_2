# Monitor and troubleshoot data migration (Stretch Database)
To monitor data migration in Stretch Database Monitor, select **Tasks | Stretch | Monitor** for a database in SQL Server Management Studio .

## Check the status of data migration in the Stretch Database Monitor
Select **Tasks | Stretch | Monitor** for a database in SQL Server Management Studio to open Stretch Database Monitor and monitor data migration.

* The top portion of the monitor displays general information about both the Stretch\-enabled SQL Server database and the remote Azure database.
* The bottom portion of the monitor displays the status of data migration for each Stretch\-enabled table in the database.

## <a name="Migration"></a>Check the status of data migration in a dynamic management view
Open the dynamic management view **sys.dm\_db\_rda\_migration\_status** to see how many batches and rows of data have been migrated. For more info, see [sys.dm_db_rda_migration_status (Transact-SQL)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn935017.aspx).

## <a name="Firewall"></a>Troubleshoot data migration
**Rows from my Stretch-enabled table are not being migrated to Azure. Whatâ€™s the problem?**

There are several problems that can affect migration. Check the following things.

* Check network connectivity for the SQL Server computer.
* Check that the Azure firewall is not blocking your SQL Server from connecting to the remote endpoint.
* Check the dynamic management view **sys.dm\_db\_rda\_migration\_status** for the status of the latest batch. If an error has occurred, check the error\_number, error\_state, and error\_severity values for the batch.
  
  * For more info about the view, see [sys.dm_db_rda_migration_status (Transact-SQL)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn935017.aspx).
  * For more info about the content of a SQL Server error message, see [sys.messages (Transact-SQL)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms187382.aspx).

**The Azure firewall is blocking connections from my local server.**

You may have to add a rule in the Azure firewall settings of the Azure server to let SQL Server communicate with the remote Azure server.
