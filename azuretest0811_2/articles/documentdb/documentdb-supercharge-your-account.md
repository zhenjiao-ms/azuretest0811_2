# Supercharge your DocumentDB account
Follow these steps to take advantage of increased throughput for your Azure DocumentDB S1 account. With little to no additional cost, you can increase the throughput of your existing S1 account from 250 [RU/s](documentdb-request-units.md) to 400 RU/s, or more!

## Change to user-defined performance in the Azure portal
1. In your browser, navigate to the [**Azure portal**](https://portal.azure.com). 
2. Click **Browse** -> **DocumentDB Accounts**, then select the DocumentDB account to modify.   
3. In the **Databases** lens, select the database to modify, and then in the **Database** blade, select the collection with the S1 pricing tier.

4. In the **Collections** blade, click **Settings** on the top bar.   
5. In the **Settings** blade, click **Pricing Tier** and notice that the monthly cost estimate for each plan is displayed. In the **Choose your pricing tier** blade, click **Standard**, and then click **Select** to save your change.

6. Back in the **Settings** blade, the **Pricing Tier** is changed to **Standard** and the **Throughput (RU/s)** box is displayed with a default value of 400. Click **OK** to save your changes. 
   
   > [!NOTE]
   > You can set the throughput between 400 and 10,000 [Request units](../articles/documentdb/documentdb-request-units.md)/second (RU/s). The **Pricing Summary** at the bottom of the page updates automatically to provide an estimate of the monthly cost.

For more information about the changes related to user-defined and pre-defined throughput, see the blog post [DocumentDB: Everything you need to know about using the new pricing options](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/documentdb-use-the-new-pricing-options-on-your-existing-collections/).

## Next steps
If you determine that you need more throughput (greater than 10,000 RU/s) or more storage (greater than 10GB) you can create a partitioned collection. To create a partitioned collection, see [Create a collection](documentdb-create-collection.md).
