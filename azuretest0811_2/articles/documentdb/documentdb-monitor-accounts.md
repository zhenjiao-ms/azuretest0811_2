# Monitor DocumentDB requests, usage, and storage
You can monitor your Azure DocumentDB accounts in the [Microsoft Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/). For each DocumentDB account, both performance metrics, such as requests and server errors, and usage metrics, such as storage consumption, are available.

## View performance metrics in the portal
1. In a new window, open the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), click **Browse**, click **DocumentDB Accounts**, and then click the name of the DocumentDB account for which you would like to view performance metrics.
2. Within the **Monitoring** lens you can, by default, see:
   
   * Total requests for the current day.
   * Total RUs ([Request Units](documentdb-request-units.md)) used during the current day.
   * Storage used.
   
   If your table displays **No data available** see the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section.
   
   ![Screen shot of the Monitoring lens which shows the total requests for today and storage usage](./media/documentdb-monitor-accounts/documentdb-total-requests-and-usage.png)
3. Clicking on the **Requests**, **Total RUs**, or **Storage** tile opens a detailed **Metric** blade.
4. The **Metric** blade shows you details about the metrics you have selected.  At the top of the blade is a graph of requests charted hourly, and below that is table that shows aggregation values for throttled and total requests.  The metric blade also shows the list of alerts which have been defined, filtered to the metrics that appear on the current metric blade (this way, if you have a number of alerts, you'll only see the relevant ones presented here).

## Customize performance metric views in the portal
1. To customize the metrics that display in a particular chart, click the chart to open it in the **Metric** blade, and then click **Edit chart**.  
   ![Screen shot of the Metric blade controls, with Edit chart highlighted](./media/documentdb-monitor-accounts/madocdb3.png)
2. On the **Edit Chart** blade, there are options to modify the metrics that display in the chart, as well as their time range.  
   ![Screen shot of the Edit Chart blade](./media/documentdb-monitor-accounts/madocdb4.png)
3. To change the metrics displayed in the part, simply select or clear the available performance metrics, and then click **OK** at the bottom of the blade.  
4. To change the time range, choose a different range (for example, **Custom**), and then click **OK** at the bottom of the blade.

## Create side-by-side charts in the portal
The Azure Portal allows you to create side-by-side metric charts.  

1. First, right-click on the chart you want to copy and select **Customize**.
   
   ![Screen shot of the Total Requests chart with the Customize option highlighted](./media/documentdb-monitor-accounts/madocdb6.png)
2. Click **Clone** on the menu to copy the part and then click **Done customizing**.
   
   ![Screen shot of the Total Requests chart with the Clone and Done customizing options highlighted](./media/documentdb-monitor-accounts/madocdb7.png)  

You may now treat this part as any other metric part, customizing the metrics and time range displayed in the part.  By doing this, you can see two different metrics chart side-by-side at the same time.

## Set up alerts in the portal
1. In the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/), click **Browse**, click **DocumentDB Accounts**, and then click the name of the DocumentDB account for which you would like to setup performance metric alerts.
2. If the **All Settings** blade is not open, click the **Settings** Command at the top left to open the blade.
   ![Screen shot of the Settings command on the Database Account Blade](./media/documentdb-monitor-accounts/madocdb10.png)
3. In the **All Settings** blade, click **Alert Rules** to open the Alert rules blade.  
   ![Screen shot of the Alert rules part selected](./media/documentdb-monitor-accounts/madocdb10.5.png)
4. In the Alert rules blade, click **Add alert**.  
   ![Screenshot of the Alert Rules blade, with the Add Alert button highlighted](./media/documentdb-monitor-accounts/madocdb11.png)
5. In the **Add an alert rule** blade, specify:
   
   * The name of the alert rule you are setting up.
   * A description of the new alert rule.
   * The metric for the alert rule.
   * The condition, threshold, and period that determine when the alert activates. For example, a server error count greater than 5 over the last 15 minutes.
   * Whether the service administrator and coadministrators are emailed when the alert fires.
   * Additional email addresses for alert notifications.

## Monitor DocumentDB programatically
The account level metrics available in the portal, such as account storage usage and total requests, are not available via the DocumentDB APIs. However, you can retrieve usage data at the collection level by using the DocumentDB APIs. To retrieve collection level data, do the following:

* To use the REST API, [perform a GET on the collection](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt489073.aspx). The quota and usage information for the collection is returned in the x-ms-resource-quota and x-ms-resource-usage headers in the response.
* To use the .NET SDK, use the [DocumentClient.ReadDocumentCollectionAsync](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.azure.documents.client.documentclient.readdocumentcollectionasync.aspx) method, which returns a [ResourceResponse](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn799209.aspx) that contains a number of usage properties such as **CollectionSizeUsage**, **DatabaseUsage**, **DocumentUsage**, and more.

To access additional metrics, use the [Azure Insights SDK](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Insights). Available metric definitions can be retrieved by calling:

    https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{SubscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{ResourceGroup}/providers/Microsoft.DocumentDb/databaseAccounts/{DocumentDBAccountName}/metricDefinitions?api-version=2015-04-08 

Queries to retrieve individual metrics use the following format:

    https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{SubecriptionId}/resourceGroups/{ResourceGroup}/providers/Microsoft.DocumentDb/databaseAccounts/{DocumentDBAccountName}/metrics?api-version=2015-04-08&$filter=%28name.value%20eq%20%27Total%20Requests%27%29%20and%20timeGrain%20eq%20duration%27PT5M%27%20and%20startTime%20eq%202016-06-03T03%3A26%3A00.0000000Z%20and%20endTime%20eq%202016-06-10T03%3A26%3A00.0000000Z

For more information, see [Retrieving Resource Metrics via the Azure Insights API](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/cloud_solution_architect/2016/02/23/retrieving-resource-metrics-via-the-azure-insights-api/).

## Troubleshooting
If your monitoring tiles display the **No data available** message, and you recently made requests or added data to the database, you can edit the tile to reflect the recent usage.

### Edit a tile to refresh current data
1. To customize the metrics that display in a particular part, click the chart to open the **Metric** blade, and then click **Edit Chart**.  
   ![Screen shot of the Metric blade controls, with Edit chart highlighted](./media/documentdb-monitor-accounts/madocdb3.png)
2. On the **Edit Chart** blade, in the **Time Range** section, click **past hour**, and then click **OK**.  
   ![Screen shot of the Edit Chart blade with past hour selected](./media/documentdb-monitor-accounts/documentdb-no-available-data-past-hour.png)
3. Your tile should now refresh showing your current data and usage.
