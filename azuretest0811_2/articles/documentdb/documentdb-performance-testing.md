# Performance and scale testing with Azure DocumentDB
Performance and scale testing is a key step in application development. For many applications, the database tier has a significant impact on the overall performance and scalability, and is therefore a critical component of performance testing. [Azure DocumentDB](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/documentdb/) is purpose-built for elastic scale and predictable performance, and therefore a great fit for applications that need a high-performance database tier. 

This article is a reference for developers implementing performance test suites for their DocumentDB workloads, or evaluating DocumentDB for high-performance application scenarios. It focuses primarily on isolated performance testing of the database, but also includes best practices for production applications.

After reading this article, you will be able to answer the following questions:   

* Where can I find a sample .NET client application for performance testing of Azure DocumentDB? 
* How do I achieve high throughput levels with Azure DocumentDB from my client application?

To get started with code, please download the project from [DocumentDB Performance Testing  Sample](https://github.com/Azure/azure-documentdb-dotnet/tree/master/samples/documentdb-benchmark). 

> [!NOTE]
> The goal of this application is to demonstrate best practices for extracting better performance out of DocumentDB with a small number of client machines. This was not made to demonstrate the peak capacity of the service, which can scale limitlessly.
> 
> 

If you're looking for client-side configuration options to improve DocumentDB performance, see [DocumentDB performance tips](documentdb-performance-tips.md).

## Run the performance testing application
The quickest way to get started is to compile and run the .NET sample below, as described in the steps below. You can also review the source code and implement similar configurations to your own client applications.

**Step 1:** Download the project from [DocumentDB Performance Testing  Sample](https://github.com/Azure/azure-documentdb-dotnet/tree/master/samples/documentdb-benchmark), or fork the Github repository.

**Step 2:** Modify the settings for EndpointUrl, AuthorizationKey, CollectionThroughput and DocumentTemplate (optional) in App.config.

> [!NOTE]
> Before provisioning collections with high throughput, please refer to the [Pricing Page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/documentdb/) to estimate the costs per collection. DocumentDB bills storage and throughput independently on an hourly basis, so you can save costs by deleting or lowering the throughput of your DocumentDB collections after testing.

**Step 3:** Compile and run the console app from the command line. You should see output like the following:

**Step 4 (if necessary):** The throughput reported (RU/s) from the tool should be the same or higher than the provisioned throughput of the collection. If not, increasing the DegreeOfParallelism in small increments may help you reach the limit. If the throughput from your client app plateaus, launching multiple instances of the app on the same or different machines will help you reach the provisioned limit across the different instances. If you need help with this step, please reach out to us via [Ask DocumentDB](askdocdb@microsoft.com) or by filing a support ticket.

Once you have the app running, you can try different [Indexing policies](documentdb-indexing-policies.md) and [Consistency levels](documentdb-consistency-levels.md) to understand their impact on throughput and latency. You can also review the source code and implement similar configurations to your own test suites or production applications.
