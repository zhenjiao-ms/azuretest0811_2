# Introducing DocumentDB - A NoSQL Database for Microsoft Azure
> [!NOTE]
> This whitepaper was last updated in 2015 and has not yet been updated to account for updates to DocumentDB such as [global distribution of data](documentdb-distribute-data-globally.md) and [partitioned collections](documentdb-partition-data.md). For a current introduction to DocumentDB, see [Introduction to DocumentDB: A NoSQL JSON Database](documentdb-introduction.md).

Not sure if DocumentDB is right for your application or data? Want to learn about how JSON data is stored and accessed in Azure DocumentDB? If so, this introductory whitepaper by David Chappell is a good place to start. It discusses how you can benefit from the flexibility that schema-free JSON data provides, enabling you to handle changes to data structure effortlessly. 

The whitepaper also walks you through the following:

* Using the DocumentDB data model to store JSON data in documents and collections within a database. 
* Working with your data by using the client libraries, the RESTful access methods, or DocumentDB SQL. 
* Running logic from the database itself by writing stored procedures (sprocs), triggers, or user defined functions (UDFs) and storing them in the collection.
* Choosing a consistency option to meet the reliability and performance needs of your application.
* Selecting a pricing option based on your throughput requirements.
