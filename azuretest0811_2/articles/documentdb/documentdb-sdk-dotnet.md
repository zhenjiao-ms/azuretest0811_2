## Release Notes
### <a name="1.9.2"/>[1.9.2](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.DocumentDB/1.9.2)
> [!IMPORTANT]
> You may receive System.NotSupportedException when querying partitioned collections. To avoid this error, uncheck the "Prefer 32-bit" option in your project properties window, on the Build tab.
> 
> 

* Added support for parallel queries for partitioned collections.
* Added support for cross partition ORDER BY and TOP queries for partitioned collections.
* Fixed the missing references to DocumentDB.Spatial.Sql.dll and Microsoft.Azure.Documents.ServiceInterop.dll that are required when referencing a DocumentDB project with a reference to the DocumentDB Nuget package.
* Fixed the ability to use parameters of different types when using user defined functions in LINQ. 
* Fixed a bug for globally replicated accounts where Upsert calls were being directed to read locations instead of write locations.
* Added methods to the IDocumentClient interface that were missing: 
  * UpsertAttachmentAsync method that takes mediaStream and options as parameters
  * CreateAttachmentAsync method that takes options as a parameter
  * CreateOfferQuery method that takes querySpec as a parameter.
* Unsealed public classes that are exposed in the IDocumentClient interface.

### <a name="1.8.0"/>[1.8.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.DocumentDB/1.8.0)
* Added the support for multi-region database accounts.
* Added support for retry on throttled requests.  User can customize the number of retries and the max wait time by configuring the ConnectionPolicy.RetryOptions property.
* Added a new IDocumentClient interface that defines the signatures of all DocumenClient properties and methods.  As part of this change, also changed extension methods that create IQueryable and IOrderedQueryable to methods on the DocumentClient class itself.
* Added configuration option to set the ServicePoint.ConnectionLimit for a given DocumentDB endpoint Uri.  Use ConnectionPolicy.MaxConnectionLimit to change the default value, which is set to 50.
* Deprecated IPartitionResolver and its implementation.  Support for IPartitionResolver is now obsolete. It's recommended that you use Partitioned Collections for higher storage and throughput.

### <a name="1.7.1"/>[1.7.1](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.DocumentDB/1.7.1)
* Added an overload to Uri based ExecuteStoredProcedureAsync method that takes RequestOptions as a parameter.

### <a name="1.6.2"/>[1.6.2](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.DocumentDB/1.6.2)
* Implemented [partitioned collections](documentdb-partition-data.md) and [user-defined performance levels](documentdb-performance-levels.md). 

### <a name="1.5.3"/>[1.5.3](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.DocumentDB/1.5.3)
* **[Fixed]** Querying DocumentDB endpoint throws: 'System.Net.Http.HttpRequestException: Error while copying content to a stream.

### <a name="1.5.2"/>[1.5.2](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.DocumentDB/1.5.2)
* Expanded LINQ support including new operators for paging, conditional expressions and range comparison.
  * Take operator to enable SELECT TOP behavior in LINQ
  * CompareTo operator to enable string range comparisons
  * Conditional (?) and coalesce operators (??)
* **[Fixed]** ArgumentOutOfRangeException when combining Model projection with Where-In in linq query.  [#81](https://github.com/Azure/azure-documentdb-dotnet/issues/81)

### <a name="1.5.1"/>[1.5.1](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.DocumentDB/1.5.1)
* **[Fixed]** If Select is not the last expression the LINQ Provider assumed no projection and produced SELECT * incorrectly.  [#58](https://github.com/Azure/azure-documentdb-dotnet/issues/58)

* **[Fixed]** BackoffRetryUtility uses the same HttpRequestMessage again instead of creating a new one on retry
* **[Obsolete]** UriFactory.CreateCollection --> should now use UriFactory.CreateDocumentCollection

### <a name="1.4.1"/>[1.4.1](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.DocumentDB/1.4.1)
* **[Fixed]** Localization issues when using non en culture info such as nl-NL etc. 

### <a name="1.4.0"/>[1.4.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.DocumentDB/1.4.0)
* ID Based Routing
  * New UriFactory helper to assist with constructing ID based resource links

  * IndexingPolicy to support Order By 
    
        **NB: Possible breaking change** 
    
        If you have existing code that provisions collections with a custom indexing policy, then your existing code will need to be updated to support the new IndexingPolicy class. If you have no custom indexing policy, then this change does not affect you.

### <a name="1.1.0"/>[1.1.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.DocumentDB/1.1.0)
* Support for partitioning data by using the new HashPartitionResolver and RangePartitionResolver classes and the IPartitionResolver

## Release & Retirement Dates
Microsoft will provide notification at least **12 months** in advance of retiring an SDK in order to smooth the transition to a newer/supported version.

New features and functionality and optimizations are only added to the current SDK, as such it is  recommend that you always upgrade to the latest SDK version as early as possible. 

Any request to DocumentDB using a retired SDK will be rejected by the service.

> [!WARNING]
> All versions of the Azure DocumentDB SDK for .NET prior to version **1.0.0** will be retired on **February 29, 2016**.
