# Preview development guidelines for DocumentDB accounts with protocol support for MongoDB
You can communicate with Azure DocumentDB through any of the open source MongoDB client [drivers](https://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/drivers/). The protocol support for MongoDB assumes that the MongoDB client drivers are communicating with a MongoDB 2.6 or later server endpoint. DocumentDB supports this by adhering to the MongoDB [wire protocol](https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/mongodb-wire-protocol/), version 2.6 (note that wire protocol version 3.2 is nearly fully supported, but certain client experiences such as version 3.2 MongoDB shell sessions may indicate that they are “degrading to 'legacy' mode”).

DocumentDB supports the core MongoDB API functions to Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) data as well as query the database. The implemented capabilities have been prioritized based on the needs of common platforms, frameworks, tools, and application patterns.

## Collections
> [!IMPORTANT]
> DocumentDB uses reserved throughput at the collection level to deliver guaranteed, predictable performance. Collections in DocumentDB, therefore, are billable entities.
> 
> 

Performance reservations are applied at the collection level so that applications can adjust performance at the lowest level of data containers in the system. The cost of a collection is therefore determined by the provisioned throughput of the collection measured in request units per second along with the total consumed storage in gigabytes. The provisioned throughput can be adjusted throughout the life of a collection to adapt to the changing processing needs and access patterns of your application. For more information, see [DocumentDB performance levels](documentdb-performance-levels.md).  

DocumentDB with protocol support for MongoDB collections are, by default, created at the Standard pricing tier with 1,000 RU/s of provisioned throughput.  You can adjust the provisioned throughput of each of your collections, as documented in [Changing performance levels using the Azure Portal](documentdb-performance-levels.md#changing-performance-levels-using-the-azure-portal).  

## CRUD operations
MongoDB Insert, Read, Update, Replace and Delete operations are fully supported. This includes support for field, array, bitwise and isolation updates as specified by MongoDB [Update operator specification](https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/operator/update/). For the Update operators that need multiple document manipulations, DocumentDB provides full ACID semantics with snapshot isolation. 

## Query operations
DocumentDB supports the full grammar of MongoDB Query with a few exceptions. Queries operating on the JSON compatible set of [BSON types](https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/bson-types/) are supported in addition to support for the MongoDB date time  format. For queries requiring non-JSON type specific operators, DocumentDB supports GUID data types. The following table provides the supported vs. unsupported aspects of MongoDB query grammar.

## Aggregation
DocumentDB does not support the MongoDB aggregation pipeline or Map-Reduce operations. The aggregation pipeline is typically used to process documents through a multi-stage set of filters and transformations such as matching and grouping results. DocumentDB natively supports both JavaScript User Defined Functions and Stored Procedure.  Additionally, DocumentDB can easily act as both a source and sink for Hive, Pig, and MapReduce jobs using Azure HDInsight via the DocumentDB [Hadoop connector](documentdb-run-hadoop-with-hdinsight.md).

## Portal experience
The Azure portal experience for MongoDB protocol enabled accounts is slightly different than the portal experience for standard DocumentDB accounts.  We are looking to expand the experience, but we need your [feedback](mailto:askdocdb@microsoft.com?subject=DocumentDB%20Protocol%20Support%20for%20MongoDB%20Preview%20Portal%20Experience) regarding what portal features would be of most use to you.
