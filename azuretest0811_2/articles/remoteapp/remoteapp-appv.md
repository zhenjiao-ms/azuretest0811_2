# Using App-V apps in Azure RemoteApp
You can use App-V applications in a Azure RemoteApp hybrid collection, which requires domain join.

Before you get started, make sure to install the App-V 5.1 client with the latest updates. You will need to create a [custom image](remoteapp-create-custom-image.md) that includes the App-V client.  

Itâ€™s easy to use your existing App-V infrastructure with Azure RemoteApp. Since a hybrid collection is deployed into an Azure VNET that has access to your domain controller and the VMs are domain joined, you can leverage your existing App-v infrastructure and deployment methods to easyily host App-V application in Azure RemoteApp. Here are some considerations that you should be aware of based on the type of App-V deployment you currently have:

| Configuration options |  | Positive | Negative |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Delivery method |Streaming (on-demand) |App is always the latest and fresh |First time latency |
|  |Mounted |Fastest; app is already present on the VM |Bloat - takes up image space (127 GB limit) |
| App location storage |Shared content |App runs in memory of Azure RemoteApp instance |Eats memory and good connection to streaming (file) server where the app resides |
|  |Disk (Cached) |Fast execution. App not dependent on availability of Content Source |Bloat - takes up image space (127 GB limit) |
| Targeting |User |Requires full standalone App-V infrastructure | |
|  |Global (machine) |Pre-publish or target using Publishing server |Need to update your Azure image if you want to update the app (huge). Takes up some space on image. |

 After you create your custom image and your hybrid collection, publish your application, assign users and enjoy your existing App-V applications hosted in Azure RemoteApp delivered to any device anywhere.
