# Validate the Azure VNET to use with Azure RemoteApp
Before you use an Azure VNET with Azure RemoteApp, you might want to validate the VNET. This helps prevent issues with connectivity.

To validate your Azure VNET, do the following:

1. Create an Azure virtual machine inside the subnet of the Azure VNET you want to use with Azure RemoteApp.
2. Connect to that VM by using the **Connect** option in the management portal.
3. Join the virtual machine to the same domain that you want to use with Azure RemoteApp. If you are creating a hybrid collection that connects to your on-premises network, join the virtual machine to your local domain.

If this is successful, the Azure VNET is ready to use with RemoteApp.

For more information about the end-to-end hybrid collection workflow, see the following articles:

* [How to plan your virtual network for Azure RemoteApp](remoteapp-planvnet.md)
* [Create a hybrid collection](remoteapp-create-hybrid-deployment.md)
