    ![](./media/storsimple-ova-deploy2-provision-hyperv/image20.png)

## Step 3: Start the virtual device and get the IP
Perform the following steps to start your virtual device and connect to it.

#### To start the virtual device
1. Start the virtual device.
   
   ![](./media/storsimple-ova-deploy2-provision-hyperv/image21.png)
2. After the device is running, select the device, right click, and select **Connect**.
   
   ![](./media/storsimple-ova-deploy2-provision-hyperv/image22.png)
3. You may have to wait 5-10 minutes for the device to be ready. A status message is displayed on the console to indicate the progress. After the device is ready, go to **Action**. Press `Ctrl + Alt + Delete` to log into the virtual device. The default user is *StorSimpleAdmin* and the default password is *Password1*.
   
   ![](./media/storsimple-ova-deploy2-provision-hyperv/image23.png)
4. For security reasons, the device administrator password expires at the first log on. You will be prompted to change the password.
   
   ![](./media/storsimple-ova-deploy2-provision-hyperv/image24.png)
   
   Enter a password that contains at least 8 characters. The password must satisfy at least 3 out of the following 4 requirements: uppercase, lowercase, numeric, and special characters. Reenter the password to confirm it. You will be notified that the password has changed.
   
   ![](./media/storsimple-ova-deploy2-provision-hyperv/image25.png)
5. After the password is successfully changed, the virtual device may restart. Wait for the device to start.
   
   ![](./media/storsimple-ova-deploy2-provision-hyperv/image26.png)
   
    The Windows PowerShell console of the device will be displayed along with a progress bar.
   
   ![](./media/storsimple-ova-deploy2-provision-hyperv/image27.png)
6. Steps 6-8 only apply when booting up in a non DHCP environment. If you are in a DHCP environment, then skip these steps and go to step 9. If you booted up your device in non DHCP environment, you will see the following screen.
   
   ![](./media/storsimple-ova-deploy2-provision-hyperv/image28m.png)
   
    You will now need to configure the network.
7. Use the `Get-HcsIpAddress` command to list the network interfaces enabled on your virtual device. If your device has a single network interface enabled, the default name assigned to this interface is `Ethernet`.
   
   ![](./media/storsimple-ova-deploy2-provision-hyperv/image29m.png)
8. Use the `Set-HcsIpAddress` cmdlet to configure the network. An example is shown below:
   
    `Set-HcsIpAddress –Name Ethernet –IpAddress 10.161.22.90 –Netmask 255.255.255.0 –Gateway 10.161.22.1`
   
    ![](./media/storsimple-ova-deploy2-provision-hyperv/image30.png)
9. After the initial setup is complete and the device has booted up, you will see the device banner text. Make a note of the IP address and the URL displayed in the banner text to manage the device. You will use this IP address to connect to the web UI of your virtual device and complete the local setup and registration.
   
   ![](./media/storsimple-ova-deploy2-provision-hyperv/image31m.png)
10. (Optional) Perform this step only if you are deploying your device in the Government Cloud. You will now enable the United States Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) mode on your device. The FIPS 140 standard defines cryptographic algorithms approved for use by US Federal government computer systems for the protection of sensitive data.
    
    1. To enable the FIPS mode, run the following cmdlet:
       
        `Enter-HcsFIPSMode`
    2. Reboot your device after you have enabled the FIPS mode so that the cryptographic validations take effect.
       
       > [!NOTE]
       > You can either enable or disable FIPS mode on your device. Alternating the device between FIPS and non-FIPS mode is not supported.
       > 
       > 

If your device does not meet the minimum configuration requirements, you will see an error in the banner text (shown below). You will need to modify the device configuration so that it has adequate resources to meet the minimum requirements. You can then restart and connect to the device. Refer to the minimum configuration requirements in [Step 1: Ensure that the host system meets minimum virtual device requirements](#step-1-ensure-that-the-host-system-meets-minimum-virtual-device-requirements).

![](./media/storsimple-ova-deploy2-provision-hyperv/image32.png)

If you face any other error during the initial configuration using the local web UI, refer to the following workflows in [Manage your StorSimple Virtual Array using the local web UI](storsimple-ova-web-ui-admin.md).

* Run diagnostic tests to [troubleshoot web UI setup](storsimple-ova-web-ui-admin.md#troubleshoot-web-ui-setup-errors).
* [Generate log package and view log files](storsimple-ova-web-ui-admin.md#generate-a-log-package).
