# Deploy StorSimple Virtual Array - Prepare the portal
![](./media/storsimple-ova-deploy1-portal-prep/getstarted4.png)

## Overview
This article applies to Microsoft Azure StorSimple Virtual Array (also known as the StorSimple on-premises virtual device or StorSimple virtual device) running March 2016 general availability (GA) release. This is the first article in the series of deployment tutorials required to completely deploy your virtual array as a file server or an iSCSI server. This article describes the preparation required to create and configure your StorSimple Manager service prior to provisioning a virtual array. This article also links out to a deployment configuration checklist as well as configuration prerequisites.

You will need administrator privileges to complete the setup and configuration process. We recommend that you review the deployment configuration checklist before you begin. The portal preparation will take less than 10 minutes.

## Configuration checklist
The configuration checklist describes the information that you need to collect before you configure the software on your StorSimple device. Preparing this information ahead of time will help streamline the process of deploying the StorSimple device in your environment. Depending upon whether your StorSimple virtual device will be deployed as a file server or an iSCSI server, you will need one of the following checklists.

* Download the [StorSimple Virtual Array File Server Configuration Checklist](http://download.microsoft.com/download/E/E/6/EE690BB0-B442-4B84-8165-4731EE727ACF/MicrosoftAzureStorSimpleVirtualArrayFileServerConfigurationChecklist.pdf).
* Download the [StorSimple Virtual Array iSCSI Server Configuration Checklist](http://download.microsoft.com/download/E/E/6/EE690BB0-B442-4B84-8165-4731EE727ACF/MicrosoftAzureStorSimpleVirtualArrayiSCSIServerConfigurationChecklist.pdf).

## Prerequisites
Here you will find the configuration prerequisites for your StorSimple Manager service, your StorSimple virtual device, and the datacenter network.

### For the StorSimple Manager service
Before you begin, make sure that:

* You have your Microsoft account with access credentials.
* You have your Microsoft Azure storage account with access credentials.
* Your Microsoft Azure subscription should be enabled for StorSimple Manager service.

### For the StorSimple virtual device
Before you deploy a virtual device, make sure that:

* You have access to a host system running Hyper-V on Windows Server 2008 R2 or later or VMware (ESXi 5.5 or later) that can be used to a provision a device.
* The host system is able to dedicate the following resources to provision your virtual device:
  
  * A minimum of 4 cores.
  * At least 8 GB of RAM.
  * One network interface.
  * A 500 GB virtual disk for system data.

### For the datacenter network
Before you begin, make sure that:

* The network in your datacenter is configured as per the networking requirements for your StorSimple device. For more information, see the [StorSimple Virtual Array System Requirements](storsimple-ova-system-requirements.md).
* Your StorSimple virtual device has a dedicated 5 Mbps Internet bandwidth (or more) available at all times. This bandwidth should not be shared with any other applications.

## Step-by-step preparation
Use the following step-by-step instructions to prepare your portal for the StorSimple Manager service.

## Step 1: Create a new service
A single instance of the StorSimple Manager service can manage multiple StorSimple 1200 devices. Perform the following steps to create a new instance of the StorSimple Manager service. If you have an existing StorSimple Manager service to manage your 1200 devices, skip this step and go to [Step2: Get the service registration key](#step-2-get-the-service-registration-key).

[!INCLUDE [storsimple-ova-create-new-service](../../includes/storsimple-ova-create-new-service.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 
> If you did not enable the automatic creation of a storage account with your service, you will need to create at least one storage account after you have successfully created a service.
> 
> * If you did not create a storage account automatically, go to [Configure a new storage account for the service](#optional-step-configure-a-new-storage-account-for-the-service) for detailed instructions.
> * If you enabled the automatic creation of a storage account, go to [Step 2: Get the service registration key](#step-2-get-the-service-registration-key).
> 
> 

## Step 2: Get the service registration key
After the StorSimple Manager service is up and running, you will need to get the service registration key. This key is used to register and connect your StorSimple device with the service.

Perform the following steps in the [Azure classic portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com/).

[!INCLUDE [storsimple-ova-get-service-registration-key](../../includes/storsimple-ova-get-service-registration-key.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> 
> The service registration key is used to register all the StorSimple Manager devices that need to register with your StorSimple Manager service.
> 
> 

## Step 3: Download the virtual device image
After you have the service registration key, you will need to download the appropriate virtual device image to provision a virtual device on your host system. The virtual device images are operating system specific and can be downloaded from the Quick Start page in the Azure classic portal.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The software running on the StorSimple Virtual Array may only be used in conjunction with the Storsimple Manager service.
