## Deployment configuration checklist
Before you deploy your device, you will need to collect information to configure the software on your StorSimple device. Preparing some of this information ahead of time will help streamline the process of deploying the StorSimple device in your environment. Download and use this checklist to note down the configuration details as you deploy your device.

* [Download StorSimple deployment configuration checklist](http://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=49159)

## Deployment prerequisites
The following sections explain the configuration prerequisites for your StorSimple Manager service and your StorSimple device.

### For the StorSimple Manager service
Before you begin, make sure that:

* You have your Microsoft account with access credentials.
* You have your Microsoft Azure storage account with access credentials.
* Your Microsoft Azure subscription is enabled for the StorSimple Manager service. Your subscription should be purchased through the [Enterprise Agreement](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/enterprise-agreement/).
* You have access to terminal emulation software such as PuTTY.

### For the device in the datacenter
Before configuring the device, make sure that your device is fully unpacked, mounted on a rack and fully cabled for power, network, and serial access as described in:

* [Unpack, rack mount, and cable your 8100 device](storsimple-8100-hardware-installation.md)
* [Unpack, rack mount, and cable your 8600 device](storsimple-8600-hardware-installation.md)

### For the network in the datacenter
Before you begin, make sure that:

* The ports in your datacenter firewall are opened to allow for iSCSI and cloud traffic as described in [Networking requirements for your StorSimple device](storsimple-system-requirements.md#networking-requirements-for-your-storsimple-device).

## Step-by-step deployment
Use the following step-by-step instructions to deploy your StorSimple device in the datacenter.

## Step 1: Create a new service
A StorSimple Manager service can manage multiple StorSimple devices. Perform the following steps to create a new instance of the StorSimple Manager service.

[!INCLUDE [storsimple-create-new-service](../../includes/storsimple-create-new-service.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you did not enable the automatic creation of a storage account with your service, you will need to create at least one storage account after you have successfully created a service. This storage account will be used when you create a volume container. 
> 
> * If you did not create a storage account automatically, go to [Configure a new storage account for the service](#configure-a-new-storage-account-for-the-service) for detailed instructions. 
> * If you enabled the automatic creation of a storage account, go to [Step 2: Get the service registration key](#step-2-get-the-service-registration-key).
> 
> 

## Step 2: Get the service registration key
After the StorSimple Manager service is up and running, you will need to get the service registration key. This key is used to register and connect your StorSimple device with the service.

Perform the following steps in the Management Portal.

[!INCLUDE [storsimple-get-service-registration-key](../../includes/storsimple-get-service-registration-key.md)]

## Step 3: Configure and register the device through Windows PowerShell for StorSimple
Use Windows PowerShell for StorSimple to complete the initial setup of your StorSimple device as explained in the following procedure. You will need to use terminal emulation software to complete this step. For more information, see [Use PuTTY to connect to the device serial console](#use-putty-to-connect-to-the-device-serial-console).

[!INCLUDE [storsimple-configure-and-register-device-u1](../../includes/storsimple-configure-and-register-device-u1.md)]

## Step 4: Complete minimum device setup
For the minimum device configuration of your StorSimple device, you are required to: 

* Set up the secondary DNS server.
* Enable iSCSI on at least one network interface.
* Assign fixed IP addresses to both the controllers.

Perform the following steps in the Management Portal to complete the minimum device setup.

[!INCLUDE [storsimple-complete-minimum-device-setup](../../includes/storsimple-complete-minimum-device-setup-u1.md)]

## Step 5: Create a volume container
A volume container has storage account, bandwidth, and encryption settings for all the volumes contained in it. You will need to create a volume container before you can start provisioning volumes on your StorSimple device. 

Perform the following steps in the Management Portal to create a volume container.

[!INCLUDE [storsimple-create-volume-container](../../includes/storsimple-create-volume-container.md)]

## Step 6: Create a volume
After you create a volume container, you can provision a storage volume on the StorSimple device for your servers. Perform the following steps in the Management Portal to create a volume.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> StorSimple Manager can create both thin and fully provisioned volumes. You cannot however create partially provisioned volumes. 
> 
> 

[!INCLUDE [storsimple-create-volume](../../includes/storsimple-create-volume-u2.md)]

## Step 7: Mount, initialize, and format a volume
The following steps are performed on your Windows Server host. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 
> * For the high availability of your StorSimple solution, we recommend that you configure MPIO on your host servers (optional) prior to configuring iSCSI. MPIO configuration on host servers will ensure that the servers can tolerate a link, network, or interface failure.
> * For MPIO and iSCSI installation and configuration instructions on Windows Server host, go to [Configure MPIO for your StorSimple device](storsimple-configure-mpio-windows-server.md). These will also include the steps to mount, initialize and format StorSimple volumes.
> * For MPIO and iSCSI installation and configuration instructions on a Linux host, go to [Configure MPIO for your StorSimple Linux host](storsimple-configure-mpio-on-linux.md)
> 
> 

If you decide not to configure MPIO, perform the following steps to mount, initialize, and format your StorSimple volumes on a Windows Server host.

[!INCLUDE [storsimple-mount-initialize-format-volume](../../includes/storsimple-mount-initialize-format-volume.md)]

## Step 8: Take a backup
Backups provide point-in-time protection of volumes and improve recoverability while minimizing restore times. You can take two types of backup on your StorSimple device: local snapshots and cloud snapshots. Each of these backup types can be **Scheduled** or **Manual**. 

Perform the following steps in the Management Portal to create a scheduled backup.

[!INCLUDE [storsimple-take-backup](../../includes/storsimple-take-backup.md)]

You can take a manual backup at any time. For procedures, go to [Create a manual backup](#create-a-manual-backup). 

## Configure a new storage account for the service
This is an optional step that you need to perform only if you did not enable the automatic creation of a storage account with your service. A Microsoft Azure storage account is required to create a StorSimple volume container.

If you need to create an Azure storage account in a different region, see [About Azure Storage Accounts](../storage/storage-create-storage-account.md) for step-by-step instructions.

Perform the following steps in the Management Portal, on the **StorSimple Manager service** page.

[!INCLUDE [storsimple-configure-new-storage-account-u1](../../includes/storsimple-configure-new-storage-account-u1.md)]

## Use PuTTY to connect to the device serial console
To connect to Windows PowerShell for StorSimple, you need to use terminal emulation software such as PuTTY. You can use PuTTY when you access the device directly through the serial console or by opening a telnet session from a remote computer.

[!INCLUDE [Use PuTTY to connect to the device serial console](../../includes/storsimple-use-putty.md)]

## Scan for and apply updates
Updating your device can take several hours. Perform the following steps to scan for and apply updates on your device.
<!--can take 1-4 hours--> 

<!--If you have a gateway configured on a network interface other than Data 0, you will need to disable Data 2 and Data 3 network interfaces before installing the update. Go to **Devices > Configure** and disable Data 2 and Data 3 interfaces. You should re-enable these interfaces after the device is updated.-->

#### To update your device
1. On the device **Quick Start** page, click **Devices**. Select the physical device, click **Maintenance** and then click **Scan Updates**.  
2. A job to scan for available updates is created. If updates are available, the **Scan Updates** changes to **Install Updates**. Click **Install Updates**. 
3. An update job will be created. Monitor the status of your update by navigating to **Jobs**.
   
   > [!NOTE]
   > When the update job starts, it immediately displays the status as 50 percent. The status changes to 100 percent only after the update job is complete. There is no real-time status for the update process.
   > 
4. After the device is successfully updated, enable Data 2 and Data 3 network interfaces if these were disabled.

<!-- In step 2, you may be requested to disable Data 2 and Data 3 prior to installing the updates. You must disable these network interfaces or the updates may fail.-->

## Get the IQN of a Windows Server host
Perform the following steps to get the iSCSI Qualified Name (IQN) of a Windows host that is running Windows Server® 2012.

[!INCLUDE [Create a manual backup](../../includes/storsimple-get-iqn.md)]

## Create a manual backup
Perform the following steps in the Management Portal to create an on-demand manual backup for a single volume on your StorSimple device.

[!INCLUDE [Create a manual backup](../../includes/storsimple-create-manual-backup.md)]

## Next steps
* Configure a [virtual device](storsimple-virtual-device-u2.md).
* Use the [StorSimple Manager service](storsimple-manager-service-administration.md) to manage your StorSimple device.
