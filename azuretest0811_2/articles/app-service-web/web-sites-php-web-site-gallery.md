# Create a WordPress web app in Azure App Service
[!INCLUDE [tabs](../../includes/app-service-web-get-started-nav-tabs.md)]

This tutorial shows how to deploy a WordPress blog site from the Azure Marketplace.

When you're done with the tutorial you'll have your own WordPress blog site up and running in the cloud.

![WordPress site](./media/web-sites-php-web-site-gallery/wpdashboard.png)

You'll learn:

* How to find an application template in the Azure Marketplace.
* How to create a web app in Azure App Service that is based on the template.
* How to configure Azure App Service settings for the new web app and database.

The Azure Marketplace makes available a wide range of popular web apps developed by Microsoft, third party companies, and open source software initiatives. The web apps are built on a wide range of popular frameworks, such as [PHP](/develop/nodejs/) in this WordPress example, [.NET](/develop/net/), [Node.js](/develop/nodejs/), [Java](/develop/java/), and [Python](/develop/python/), to name a few. To create a web app from the Azure Marketplace the only software you need is the browser that you use for the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/). 

The WordPress site that you deploy in this tutorial uses MySQL for the database. If you wish to instead use SQL Database for the database, see [Project Nami](http://projectnami.org/). **Project Nami** is also available through the Marketplace.

> [!NOTE]
> To complete this tutorial, you need a Microsoft Azure account. If you don't have an account, you can [activate your Visual Studio subscriber benefits](/pricing/member-offers/msdn-benefits-details/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) or [sign up for a free trial](/en-us/pricing/free-trial/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
> 
> If you want to get started with Azure App Service before you sign up for an Azure account, go to [Try App Service](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=523751). There, you can immediately create a short-lived starter web app in App Serviceâ€”no credit card required, and no commitments.

## Select WordPress and configure for Azure App Service
1. Log in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
2. Click **New**.
   
    ![Create New](./media/web-sites-php-web-site-gallery/startmarketplace.png)
3. Search for **WordPress**, and then click **WordPress**. If you wish to use SQL Database instead of MySQL, search for **Project Nami**.
   
    ![WordPress from list](./media/web-sites-php-web-site-gallery/search-web-app.png)
4. After reading the description of the WordPress app, click **Create**.
   
    ![Create](./media/web-sites-php-web-site-gallery/create.png)
5. Enter a name for the web app in the **Web app** box.
   
    This name must be unique in the azurewebsites.net domain because the URL of the web app will be {name}.azurewebsites.net. If the name you enter isn't unique, a red exclamation mark appears in the text box.
6. If you have more than one subscription, choose the one you want to use. 
7. Select a **Resource Group** or create a new one.
   
    For more information about resource groups, see [Azure Resource Manager overview](../resource-group-overview.md).
8. Select an **App Service plan/Location** or create a new one.
   
    For more information about App Service plans, see [Azure App Service plans overview](../app-service/azure-web-sites-web-hosting-plans-in-depth-overview.md)    
9. Click **Database**, and then in the **New MySQL Database** blade provide the required values for configuring your MySQL database.
   
    a. Enter a new name or leave the default name.
   
    b. Leave the **Database Type** set to **Shared**.
   
    c. Choose the same location as the one you chose for the web app.
   
    d. Choose a pricing tier. Mercury (free with minimal allowed connections and disk space) is fine for this tutorial.
10. In the **New MySQL Database** blade, click **OK**. 
11. In the **WordPress** blade, accept the legal terms, and then click **Create**. 
    
     ![Configure web app](./media/web-sites-php-web-site-gallery/configure.png)
    
     Azure App Service creates the web app, typically in less than a minute. You can watch the progress by clicking the bell icon at the top of the portal page.
    
     ![Progress indicator](./media/web-sites-php-web-site-gallery/progress.png)

## Launch and manage your WordPress web app
1. When the web app creation is finished, navigate in the Azure Portal to the resource group in which you created the application, and you can see the web app and the database.
   
    The extra resource with the light bulb icon is [Application Insights](/services/application-insights/), which provides monitoring services for your web app.
2. In the **Resource group** blade, click the web app line.
   
    ![Configure web app](./media/web-sites-php-web-site-gallery/resourcegroup.png)
3. In the Web app blade, click **Browse**.
   
    ![site URL](./media/web-sites-php-web-site-gallery/browse-web.png)
4. In the WordPress **Welcome** page, enter the configuration information required by WordPress, and then click **Install WordPress**.
   
    ![Configure WordPress](./media/web-sites-php-web-site-gallery/wpconfigure.png)
5. Log in using the credentials you created on the **Welcome** page.  
6. Your site Dashboard page opens.
