# Network Configuration Details for App Service Environments with ExpressRoute
## Overview
Customers can connect an [Azure ExpressRoute](http://azure.microsoft.com/services/expressroute/) circuit to their virtual network infrastructure, thus extending their on-premises network to Azure.  An App Service Environment can  be created in a subnet of this [virtual network](http://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-network/) infrastructure.  Apps running on the App Service Environment can then establish secure connections to back-end resources accessible only over the ExpressRoute connection.  

An App Service Environment can be created in **either** an Azure Resource Manager virtual network, **or** a classic deployment model virtual network.  With a recent change made in June 2016, ASEs can also now be deployed into virtual networks that use either public address ranges, or RFC1918 address spaces (i.e. private addresses).

## Required Network Connectivity
There are network connectivity requirements for App Service Environments that may not be initially met in a virtual network connected to an ExpressRoute.  App Service Environments require all of the following in order to function properly:

* Outbound network connectivity to Azure Storage endpoints worldwide on both ports 80 and 443.  This includes endpoints located in the same region as the App Service Environment, as well as storage endpoints located in **other** Azure regions.  Azure Storage endpoints resolve under the following DNS domains: *table.core.windows.net*, *blob.core.windows.net*, *queue.core.windows.net* and *file.core.windows.net*.  
* Outbound network connectivity to the Azure Files service on port 445.
* Outbound network connectivity to Sql DB endpoints located in the same region as the App Service Environment.  Sql DB endpoints resolve under the following domain:  *database.windows.net*.  This requires opening access to ports 1433, 11000-11999 and 14000-14999.  For more details see [this article on Sql Database V12 port usage](../sql-database/sql-database-develop-direct-route-ports-adonet-v12.md).
* Outbound network connectivity to the Azure management plane endpoints (both ASM and ARM endpoints).  This includes outbound connectivity to both *management.core.windows.net* and *management.azure.com*. 
* Outbound network connectivity to *ocsp.msocsp.com*, *mscrl.microsoft.com* and *crl.microsoft.com*.  This is needed to support SSL functionality.
* The DNS configuration for the virtual network must be capable of resolving all of the endpoints and domains mentioned in the earlier points.  If these endpoints cannot be resolved, App Service Environment creation attempts will fail, and existing App Service Environments will be marked as unhealthy.
* Outbound access on port 53 is required for communication with DNS servers.
* If a custom DNS server exists on the other end of a VPN gateway, the DNS server must be reachable from the subnet containing the App Service Environment. 
* The outbound network path cannot travel through internal corporate proxies, nor can it be force tunneled to on-premises.  Doing so changes the effective NAT address of outbound network traffic from the App Service Environment.  Changing the NAT address of an App Service Environment's outbound network traffic will cause connectivity failures to many of the endpoints listed above.  This results in failed App Service Environment creation attempts, as well as previously healthy App Service Environments being marked as unhealthy.  
* Inbound network access to required ports for App Service Environments must be allowed as described in this [article](http://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/app-service-app-service-environment-control-inbound-traffic/).

The DNS requirements can be met by ensuring a valid DNS infrastructure is configured and maintained for the virtual network.  If for any reason the DNS configuration is changed after an App Service Environment has been created, developers can force an App Service Environment to pick up the new DNS configuration.  Triggering a rolling environment reboot using the "Restart" icon located at the top of the App Service Environment management blade in the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) will cause the environment to pick up the new DNS configuration.

The inbound network access requirements can be met by configuring a [network security group](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/virtual-networks-nsg/) on the App Service Environment's subnet to allow the required access as described in this [article](http://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/app-service-app-service-environment-control-inbound-traffic/).

## Enabling Outbound Network Connectivity for an App Service Environment
By default, a newly created ExpressRoute circuit advertises a default route that allows outbound Internet connectivity.  With this configuration an App Service Environment will be able to connect to other Azure endpoints.

However a common customer configuration is to define their own default route (0.0.0.0/0) which forces outbound Internet traffic to instead flow on-premises.  This traffic flow invariably breaks App Service Environments because the outbound traffic is either blocked on-premises, or NAT'd to an unrecognizable set of addresses that no longer work with various Azure endpoints.

The solution is to define one (or more) user defined routes (UDRs) on the subnet that contains the App Service Environment.  A UDR defines subnet-specific routes that will be honored instead of the default route.

If possible, it is recommended to use the following configuration:

* The ExpressRoute configuration advertises 0.0.0.0/0 and by default force tunnels all outbound traffic on-premises.
* The UDR applied to the subnet containing the App Service Environment defines 0.0.0.0/0 with a next hop type of Internet (an example of this is farther down in this article).

The combined effect of these steps is that the subnet level UDR will take precedence over the ExpressRoute forced tunneling, thus ensuring outbound Internet access from the App Service Environment.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The routes defined in a UDR **must** be specific enough to  take precedence over any routes advertised by the ExpressRoute configuration.  The example below uses the broad 0.0.0.0/0 address range, and as such can potentially be accidentally overridden by route advertisements using more specific address ranges.
> 
> App Service Environments are not supported with ExpressRoute configurations that **incorrectly cross-advertise routes from the public peering path to the private peering path**.  ExpressRoute configurations that have public peering configured, will receive route advertisements from Microsoft for a large set of Microsoft Azure IP address ranges.  If these address ranges are incorrectly cross-advertised on the private peering path, the end result is that all outbound network packets from the App Service Environment's subnet will be incorrectly force-tunneled to a customer's on-premises network infrastructure.  This network flow will break App Service Environments.  The solution to this problem is to stop cross-advertising routes from the public peering path to the private peering path.

Background information on user defined routes is available in this [overview](http://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/virtual-networks-udr-overview/).  

Details on creating and configuring user defined routes is available in this [How To Guide](http://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/virtual-networks-udr-how-to/).

## Example UDR Configuration for an App Service Environment
**Pre-requisites**

1. Install the very latest Azure Powershell from the [Azure Downloads page](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/) (dated June 2015 or later).  Under "Command-line tools" there is an "Install" link under "Windows Powershell" that will install the latest Powershell cmdlets.
2. It is recommended that a unique subnet is created for exclusive use by an App Service Environment.  This ensures that the UDRs applied to the subnet will only open outbound traffic for the App Service Environment.
3. **Important**:  do not deploy the App Service Environment until **after** the following configuration steps are followed.  This ensures that outbound network connectivity is available before attempting to deploy an App Service Environment.

**Step 1:  Create a named route table**

The following snippet creates a route table called "DirectInternetRouteTable" in the West US Azure region:

    New-AzureRouteTable -Name 'DirectInternetRouteTable' -Location uswest

**Step 2:  Create one or more routes in the route table**

You will need to add one or more routes to the route table in order to enable outbound Internet access.  

The recommended approach for configuring outbound access to the Internet is to define a route for 0.0.0.0/0 as shown below.

    Get-AzureRouteTable -Name 'DirectInternetRouteTable' | Set-AzureRoute -RouteName 'Direct Internet Range 0' -AddressPrefix 0.0.0.0/0 -NextHopType Internet

Remember that 0.0.0.0/0 is a broad address range, and as such will be overriden by more specific address ranges advertised by the ExpressRoute.  To re-iterate the earlier recommendation, a UDR with a 0.0.0.0/0 route should be used in conjunction with an ExressRoute configuration that only advertises 0.0.0.0/0 as well. 

As an alternative, you can download a comprehensive and updated list of CIDR ranges in use by Azure.  The Xml file containing all of the Azure IP address ranges is available from the [Microsoft Download Center](http://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=41653).  

Note though that these ranges change over time, thus necessitating periodic manual updates to a UDR to keep in sync.  Also, since there is an upper limit of 100 routes in a single UDR, you will need to "summarize" the Azure IP address ranges to fit within the 100 route limit, keeping in mind that UDR defined routes need to be more specific than the routes advertised by your ExpressRoute.   

**Step 3:  Associate the route table to the subnet containing the App Service Environment**

The last  configuration step is to associate the route table to the subnet where the App Service Environment will be deployed.  The following command associates the "DirectInternetRouteTable" to the "ASESubnet" that will eventually contain an App Service Environment.

    Set-AzureSubnetRouteTable -VirtualNetworkName 'YourVirtualNetworkNameHere' -SubnetName 'ASESubnet' -RouteTableName 'DirectInternetRouteTable'


**Step 4:  Final Steps**

Once the route table is bound to the subnet, it is recommended to first test and confirm the intended effect.  For example, deploy a virtual machine into the subnet and confirm that:

* Outbound traffic to both Azure and non-Azure endpoints mentioned earlier in this article is **not** flowing down the ExpressRoute circuit.  It is very important to verify this behavior, since if outbound traffic from the subnet is still being forced tunneled on-premises, App Service Environment creation will always fail. 
* DNS lookups for the endpoints mentioned earlier are all resolving properly. 

Once the above steps are confirmed, you will need to delete the virtual machine because the subnet needs to be "empty" at the time the App Service Environment is created.

Then proceed with creating an App Service Environment!
