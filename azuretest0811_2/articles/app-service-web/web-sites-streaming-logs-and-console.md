# Streaming Logs and the Console
### Streaming Logs
The Microsoft Azure Portal provides an integrated streaming log viewer that 
lets you view tracing events from your App Service apps in real time.  

Setting this up requires a few simple steps:

* Write traces in your code
* Enable Application Diagnostics from within the Azure Portal
* Click on the streaming logs part on the web app's blade

### How to write traces in your code
Writing traces in your code is easy.  In C# it's as easy as writing the following code:

`````````````````````````
Trace.TraceInformation("My trace statement");
`````````````````````````

`````````````````````````
Trace.TraceWarning("My warning statement");
`````````````````````````

`````````````````````````
Trace.TraceError("My error statement");
`````````````````````````

The Trace class lives in the System.Diagnostics namespace.

In a node.js app you can write this code to achieve the same result:

`````````````````````````
console.log("My trace statement").
`````````````````````````

### How to enable and view the streaming logs
![](./media/web-sites-streaming-logs-and-console/browse-sites.png)
Diagnostics are enabled on a per web app basis. From within the 
[portal](https://portal.azure.com) browse to the site you would like to enable 
this feature for.  

![](./media/web-sites-streaming-logs-and-console/diagnostic-logs.png)
Then click **(1) Settings** > **(2) Diagnostic Logs** and **(3)turn  On** 
**Application Logging (Filesystem)** or **Application Logging (blob)** The 
**Level** option lets you change the severity level of traces to capture.  
You should set this to **Verbose** if you're just trying to get familiar with 
the feature as this will ensure all of your trace statements get logged.

Click **SAVE** at the top of the blade and you're ready to view logs.

**NOTE:** The higher the **severity level** the more resources are consumed to 
log and the more traces you will get. Make sure this is set to the appropriate
 level when using this feature for a high traffic / production site. 

![](./media/web-sites-streaming-logs-and-console/streaming-logs.png)
To view the streaming logs from within the portal click **(1) Tools** > 
**(2) Log Stream**. If your app is actively writing trace statements then you 
should see them in the **(3)** resulting window in near real time.

## Console
The Azure Portal provides console access to your web app environment. You can 
explore your web app's file system and run powershell/cmd scripts. You are 
bound by the same permissions set as your running web app code when executing 
console commands. You won't be able to access protected directories or run 
scripts that require elevated permissions.  

![](./media/web-sites-streaming-logs-and-console/console.png)
To get to the console, browse to a web app as described in the section above. 
Click on **(1)Tools**>**(2)Console** and the **(3)** console will open.

To get familiar with the console try basic commands like these:

`````````````````````````
dir
`````````````````````````

`````````````````````````
cd
`````````````````````````
