# Working with Azure Resource Manager Templates in Visual Studio Code
Azure Resource Manager templates are JSON files that describe a resource and related dependencies. These files can sometimes be large and complicated so tooling support is important. Visual Studio Code is a new, lightweight, open-source, cross-platform code editor. It supports creating and editing Resource Manager templates through a [new extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msazurermtools.azurerm-vscode-tools). VS Code runs everywhere and doesn't require Internet access unless you also want to deploy your Resource Manager templates.

If you do not already have VS Code, you can install it at [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Install the Resource Manager extension
To work with the JSON templates in VS Code, you need to install an extension. The following steps download and install the language support for Resource Manager JSON templates:

1. Launch VS Code 
2. Open Quick Open (Ctrl+P) 
3. Run the following command: 
   
        ext install azurerm-vscode-tools
4. Restart VS Code when prompted to enable the extension. 
   
   Job done!

## Set up Resource Manager snippets
The previous steps installed the tooling support, but now we need to configure VS Code to use JSON template snippets.

1. Copy the contents of the file from the [azure-xplat-arm-tooling](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-xplat-arm-tooling/master/VSCode/armsnippets.json) repository to your clipboard.
2. Launch VS Code 
3. In VS Code, you can open the JSON snippets file by either navigating to **File** -> **Preferences** -> **User Snippets** -> **JSON**, or by selecting **F1** and typing **preferences** until you can select **Preferences: Snippets**.
   
    ![preference snippets](./media/resource-manager-vs-code/preferences-snippets.png)
   
    From the options, select **JSON**.
   
    ![select json](./media/resource-manager-vs-code/select-json.png)
4. Paste the contents of the file on step 1 into your user snippets file before the final "}" 
5. Make sure the JSON looks OK and there are no squiggles anywhere. 
6. Save and close the user snippets file.

That's all that's needed to start using the Resource Manager snippets. Next, we'll put this setup to the test.

## Work with template in VS Code
The easiest way to start working with a template is to either grab one of the Quick Start Templates available on [Github](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates) or use one of your own. You can easily [export a template](resource-manager-export-template.md) for any of your resource groups through the portal. 

1. If you exported a template from a resource group, open the extracted files in VS Code.
   
    ![show files](./media/resource-manager-vs-code/show-files.png)
2. Open the template.json file so that you can edit it and add some additional resources. After the **"resources": [** press enter to start a new line. If you type **arm**, you'll be presented with a list of options. These options are the template snippets you installed. It should look like this: 
   
    ![show snippets](./media/resource-manager-vs-code/type-snippets.png)
3. Choose the snippet you wish. For this article, I am choosing **arm-ip** to create a new public IP address. Put a comma after the closing bracket "}" of the newly created resource to make sure your template syntax is valid.
   
     ![add comma](./media/resource-manager-vs-code/add-comma.png)
4. VS Code has built-in IntelliSense. As you edit your templates, VS Code suggests available values. For example, to add a variables section to your template, add **""** (two double-quotes) and select **Ctrl+Space** between those quotes. You will be presented with options including **variables**.
   
    ![add variables](./media/resource-manager-vs-code/add-variables.png)
5. Intellisense can also suggest available values or functions. To set a property to a parameter value, create an expression with **"[]"** and **Ctrl+Space**. You can start typing the name of a function. Select **Tab** when you have found the function you want.
   
    ![add parameter](./media/resource-manager-vs-code/select-parameters.png)
6. Select **Ctrl+Space** again within the function to see a list of the available parameters within your template.
   
    ![add parameter](./media/resource-manager-vs-code/select-avail-parameters.png)
7. If you have any schema validation issues in your template, you'll see the familiar squiggles in the editor. You can view the list of errors and warnings by typing **Ctrl+Shift+M** or selecting the glyphs in the lower left status bar.
   
    ![errors](./media/resource-manager-vs-code/errors.png)
   
    Validation of your template can help you detect syntax problems; however, you may also see errors that you can ignore. In some cases, the editor is comparing your template against a schema that is not up-to-date and therefore reports an error even though you know it is correct. For example, suppose a function has recently been added to Resource Manager but the schema has not been updated. The editor reports an error despite the fact the function works correctly during deployment.
   
    ![error message](./media/resource-manager-vs-code/unrecognized-function.png)

## Deploy your new resources
When your template is ready, you can deploy the new resources following the instructions below: 

### Windows
1. Open a PowerShell command prompt 
2. To login type: 
   
        Login-AzureRmAccount 
3. If you have multiple subscriptions, get a list of the subscriptions with:
   
        Get-AzureRmSubscription
   
    And select the subscription to use.
   
        Select-AzureRmSubscription -SubscriptionId <Subscription Id>
4. Update the parameters in your parameters.json file
5. Run the Deploy.ps1 to deploy your template on Azure

### OSX/Linux
1. Open a terminal window 
2. To login type:
   
        azure login 
3. If you have multiple subscriptions, select the right subscription with:
   
        azure account set <subscriptionNameOrId> 
4. Update the parameters in the parameters.json file.
5. To deploy the template, run:
   
        azure group deployment create -f <PathToTemplate>
