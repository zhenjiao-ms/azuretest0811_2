# Create and Manage Hybrid Connections
## Overview of the Steps
1. Create a Hybrid Connection by entering the **host name** or **FQDN** of the on-premises resource in your private network.
2. Link your Azure web apps or Azure mobile apps to the Hybrid Connection.
3. Install the Hybrid Connection Manager on your on-premises resource and connect to the specific Hybrid Connection. The Azure portal provides a single-click experience to install and connect.
4. Manage Hybrid Connections and their connection keys.

This topic lists these steps. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It is possible to set a Hybrid Connection endpoint to an IP address. If you use an IP address, you may or may not reach the on-premises resource, depending on your client. The Hybrid Connection depends on the client doing a DNS lookup. In most cases, the **client** is your application code. If the client does not perform a DNS lookup, (it does not try to resolve the IP address as if it were a domain name (x.x.x.x)), then traffic is not sent through the Hybrid Connection.
> 
> For example (pseudocode), you define **10.4.5.6** as your on-premises host:
> 
> **The following scenario works:**  
> `Application code -> GetHostByName("10.4.5.6") -> Resolves to 127.0.0.3 -> Connect("127.0.0.3") -> Hybrid Connection -> on-prem host`
> 
> **The following scenario doesn't work:**  
> `Application code -> Connect("10.4.5.6") -> ?? -> No route to host`

## <a name="CreateHybridConnection"></a>Create a Hybrid Connection
A Hybrid Connection can be created in the Azure portal using Web Apps **or** using BizTalk Services. 

**To create Hybrid Connections using Web Apps**, see [Connect Azure Web Apps to an On-Premises Resource](../app-service-web/web-sites-hybrid-connection-get-started.md). You can also install the Hybrid Connection Manager (HCM) from your web app, which is the preferred method. 

**To create Hybrid Connections in BizTalk Services**:

1. Sign in to the [Azure classic portal](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=213885).
2. In the left navigation pane, select **BizTalk Services** and then select your BizTalk Service. 
   
    If you don't have an existing BizTalk Service, you can [Create a BizTalk Service](biztalk-provision-services.md).
3. Select the **Hybrid Connections** tab:  
   ![Hybrid Connections Tab](./media/integration-hybrid-connection-create-manage/WABS_HybridConnectionTab.png)
4. Select **Create a Hybrid Connection** or select the **ADD** button in the task bar. Enter the following:
   
   | Property | Description |
   | --- | --- |
   | Name |The Hybrid Connection name must be unique and cannot be the same name as the BizTalk Service. You can enter any name but be specific with its purpose. Examples include:<br/><br/>Payroll*SQLServer*<br/>SupplyList*SharepointServer*<br/>Customers*OracleServer* |
   | Host Name |Enter the fully qualified host name, only the host name, or the IPv4 address of the on-premises resource. Examples include:<br/><br/>mySQLServer<br/>*mySQLServer*.*Domain*.corp.*yourCompany*.com<br/>*myHTTPSharePointServer*<br/>*myHTTPSharePointServer*.*yourCompany*.com<br/>10.100.10.10<br/><br/>If you use the IPv4 address, note that your client or application code may not resolve the IP address. See the Important note at the top of this topic. |
   | Port |Enter the port number of the on-premises resource. For example, if you're using Web Apps, enter port 80 or port 443. If you're using SQL Server, enter port 1433. |
5. Select the check mark to complete the setup. 

#### Additional
* Multiple Hybrid Connections can be created. See the [BizTalk Services: Editions Chart](biztalk-editions-feature-chart.md) for the number of connections allowed. 
* Each Hybrid Connection is created with a pair of connection strings: Application keys that SEND and On-premises keys that LISTEN. Each pair has a Primary and a Secondary key. 

## <a name="LinkWebSite"></a>Link your Azure Web Apps or Azure Mobile Apps
To link the Azure Web Apps to an existing Hybrid Connection, select **use an existing Hybrid Connection** in the Hybrid Connections blade. See [Connect Azure Web Apps to an On-Premises Resource](../app-service-web/web-sites-hybrid-connection-get-started.md).

To link the Azure Mobile Apps to an existing Hybrid Connection, select **add hybrid connection** when changing or creating a Mobile Service. See [Azure Mobile Services and Hybrid Connections](../mobile-services/mobile-services-dotnet-backend-hybrid-connections-get-started.md).

## <a name="InstallHCM"></a>Install the Hybrid Connection Manager on-premises
After a Hybrid Connection is created, install the Hybrid Connection Manager on the on-premises resource. It can be downloaded from your Azure web apps or from your BizTalk Service. BizTalk Services steps: 

1. Sign in to the [Azure classic portal](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=213885).
2. In the left navigation pane, select **BizTalk Services** and then select your BizTalk Service. 
3. Select the **Hybrid Connections** tab:  
   ![Hybrid Connections Tab](./media/integration-hybrid-connection-create-manage/WABS_HybridConnectionTab.png)
4. In the task bar, select **On-Premises Setup**:  
   ![On-Premises Setup](./media/integration-hybrid-connection-create-manage/WABS_HybridConnectionOnPremSetup.png)
5. Select **Install and Configure** to run or download the Hybrid Connection Manager on the on-premises system. 
6. Select the check mark to start the installation. 

<!--
You can also download the Hybrid Connection Manager MSI file and copy the file to your on-premises resource. Specific steps:

1. Copy the on-premises primary Connection String. See [Manage Hybrid Connections](#ManageHybridConnection) in this topic for the specific steps.
2. Download the Hybrid Connection Manager MSI file. 
3. On the on-premises resource, install the Hybrid Connection Manager from the MSI file. 
4. Using Windows PowerShell, type: 
> Add-HybridConnection -ConnectionString “*Your On-Premises Connection String that you copied*” 
--> 

#### Additional
* Hybrid Connection Manager can be installed on the following operating systems:
  
  * Windows Server 2008 R2 (.NET Framework 4.5+ and Windows Management Framework 4.0+ required)
  * Windows Server 2012 (Windows Management Framework 4.0+ required)
  * Windows Server 2012 R2
* After you install the Hybrid Connection Manager, the following occurs: 
  
  * The Hybrid Connection hosted on Azure is automatically configured to use the Primary Application Connection String. 
  * The On-Premises resource is automatically configured to use the Primary On-Premises Connection String.
* The Hybrid Connection Manager must use a valid on-premises connection string for authorization. The Azure Web Apps or Mobile Apps must use a valid application connection string for authorization.
* You can scale Hybrid Connections by installing another instance of the Hybrid Connection Manager on another server. Configure the on-premises listener to use the same address as the first on-premises listener. In this situation, the traffic is randomly distributed (round robin) between the active on-premises listeners. 

## <a name="ManageHybridConnection"></a>Manage Hybrid Connections
To manage your Hybrid Connections, you can:

* Use the Azure portal and go to your BizTalk Service. 
* Use [REST APIs](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn232347.aspx).

#### Copy/regenerate the Hybrid Connection Strings
1. Sign in to the [Azure classic portal](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=213885).
2. In the left navigation pane, select **BizTalk Services** and then select your BizTalk Service. 
3. Select the **Hybrid Connections** tab:  
   ![Hybrid Connections Tab](./media/integration-hybrid-connection-create-manage/WABS_HybridConnectionTab.png)
4. Select the Hybrid Connection. In the task bar, select **Manage Connection**:  
   ![Manage Options](./media/integration-hybrid-connection-create-manage/WABS_HybridConnectionManageConn.png)
   
    **Manage Connection** lists the Application and On-Premises connection strings. You can copy the Connection Strings or regenerate the Access Key used in the connection string. 
   
    **If you select Regenerate**, the Shared Access Key used within the Connection String is changed. Do the following:
   
   * In the Azure classic portal, select **Sync Keys** in the Azure application.
   * Re-run the **On-Premises Setup**. When you re-run the On-Premises Setup, the on-premises resource is automatically configured to use the updated Primary connection string.

#### Use Group Policy to control the on-premises resources used by a Hybrid Connection
1. Download the [Hybrid Connection Manager Administrative Templates](http://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=42963).
2. Extract the files.
3. On the computer that modifies group policy, do the following:  
   
   * Copy the .ADMX files to the *%WINROOT%\PolicyDefinitions* folder.
   * Copy the .ADML files to the *%WINROOT%\PolicyDefinitions\en-us* folder.

Once copied, you can use Group Policy Editor to change the policy.
