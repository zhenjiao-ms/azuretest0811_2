# How to activate or deactivate roles in Azure AD Privileged Identity Management
Azure Active Directory (AD) Privileged Identity Management simplifies how enterprises manage privileged identities and access to resources in Azure AD as well as other Microsoft online services like Office 365 or Microsoft Intune.  

If you have been made eligible for an administrative role, that means you can activate that role when you need to perform a task that requires that role. For example, if you only need to manage Office 365 sometimes, your organization's privileged role administrators don't want to make you a permanent admin. Instead, they make you eligible for the Global Administrator or Exchange Online Administrator roles in Azure AD. Then, you request a temporary role assignment when you need those privileges, and you'll have admin control for Office 365 for a predetermined time period.

This article is for admins who need to activate their role in Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM). It will walk you through the steps to activate a role when you need the permissions, and deactivate the role when you're done.

## Add the Privileged Identity Management application
Use the Azure AD Privileged Identity Management application in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) to request a role activation even if you're going to operate in another portal or PowerShell. If you don't have the Azure AD Privileged Identity Management application on your Azure portal, follow these steps to get started.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
2. If your organization has more than one directory, click on your username in the upper right hand corner of the Azure portal, and select the directory where you will you be operating.
3. Select **New** > **Security + Identity** > **Azure AD Privileged Identity Management**.

4. Check **Pin to dashboard** and then click **Create**. The Privileged Identity Management application will open.

## Activate a role
When you need to take on a role, you can request activation using the **Activate my roles** button in the Azure AD Privileged Identity Management application.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and select the Azure AD Privileged Identity Management tile.
2. Select **Activate my roles**. A list of roles that have been assigned to you will appear.
3. Select the role you want to activate.
4. Select **Activate**. The **Request role activation** blade will appear.
5. Some roles require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) before you can activate the role. You only have to do this once per session.

6. Enter the reason for the activation request in the text field.  Some roles require you to supply a trouble ticket number.
7. Select **OK**.  The role will now be activated and the role change will become visible in the Microsoft Online Services.

## Deactivate a role
Once a role has been activated, it will automatically deactivate when its time limit is reached.

If you are done early, you can also deactivate a role manually in the Azure AD Privileged Identity Management application.  Select **Activate my roles**, choose the role you're done using, and select **Deactivate**.
