# Azure AD Connect sync: Synchronization Service Manager

The Connectors tab is used to manage all systems the sync engine is connected to.

## Connector actions
| Action | Comment |
| --- | --- |
| Create |Do not use. For connecting to additional AD forests, use the installation wizard. |
| Properties |Used for domain and OU filtering. |
| [Delete](#delete) |Used to either delete the data in the connector space or to delete connection to a forest. |
| [Configure Run Profiles](#configure-run-profiles) |With the exception of domain filtering, nothing to configure here. You can use this to see already configured run profiles. |
| Run |Used to start a one-off run of a profile. |
| Stop |Stops a Connector currently running a profile. |
| Export Connector |Do not use. |
| Import Connector |Do not use. |
| Update Connector |Do not use. |
| Refresh Schema |Refreshes the cached schema. It is preferred to use the option in the installation wizard instead since that will also update sync rules. |
| [Search Connector Space](#search-connector-space) |Used to find objects and to [Follow an object and its data through the system](#follow-an-object-and-its-data-through-the-system). |

### Delete
The delete action is used for two different things.
![Sync Service Manager](./media/active-directory-aadconnectsync-service-manager-ui/connectordelete.png)

The option **Delete connector space only** will remove all data, but keep all configuration.

The option **Delete Connector and connector space** will remove the data as well as all configuration. This is used when you do not want to connect to a forest anymore.

Both options will sync all objects and update the metaverse objects. This is a long running operation.

### Configure Run Profiles
This option allows you to see the run profiles configured for a Connector.

### Search Connector Space
The search connector space action is useful to find objects and troubleshoot data issues.

![Sync Service Manager](./media/active-directory-aadconnectsync-service-manager-ui/cssearch.png)

Start by selecting a **scope**. You can search based on data (RDN, DN, Anchor, Sub-Tree), or state of the object (all other options).  
![Sync Service Manager](./media/active-directory-aadconnectsync-service-manager-ui/cssearchscope.png)  
If you for example do a Sub-Tree search you get all objects in one OU.
![Sync Service Manager](./media/active-directory-aadconnectsync-service-manager-ui/cssearchsubtree.png)
From this you can select an object, select **properties** and [follow it](#follow-an-object-and-its-data-through-the-system) from the source connector space, through the metaverse, and to the target connector space.

## Follow an object and its data through the system
When you are troubleshooting a problem with data, follow an object from the source connector space, to the metaverse, and to the target connector space is a key procedure to understand why data does not have the expected values.

### Connector Space Object Properties
**Import**  
When you open a cs object, there are several tabs at the top. The **Import** tab shows the data which is staged after an import.
![Sync Service Manager](./media/active-directory-aadconnectsync-service-manager-ui/csimport.png)
The **Old Value** shows what currently is stored in the system and the **New Value** what has been received from the source system and has not been applied yet. In this case since there is a synchronization error, the change cannot be applied.

**Error**  
The error page is only visible if there is a problem with the object. See the details on the operations page for more information on how to [troubleshoot synchronization errors](active-directory-aadconnectsync-service-manager-ui-operations.md#troubleshoot-errors-in-operations-tab).

**Lineage**  
The lineage tab shows how the connector space object is related to the metaverse object. We can see when we last imported a change from the connected system and which rules applied to populate data in the metaverse.
![Sync Service Manager](./media/active-directory-aadconnectsync-service-manager-ui/cslineage.png)
In the **Action** column we can see there is one **Inbound** sync rule with the action **Provision**. That indicates that as long as this connector space object is present, the metaverse object will remain. If the list of sync rules instead shows a sync rule with direction **Outbound** and **Provision** it indicates that this object will be deleted when the metaverse object is deleted.
![Sync Service Manager](./media/active-directory-aadconnectsync-service-manager-ui/cslineageout.png)
We can also see in the **PasswordSync** column that the inbound connector space can contribute changes to the password since one sync rule has the value **True**. This password is then sent to Azure AD through the outbound rule.

From the lineage tab you can get to the metaverse by clicking on [Metaverse Object Properties](#metaverse-object-properties).

At the bottom of all tabs are two buttons: **Preview** and **Log**.

**Preview**  
The preview page is used to synchronize one single object. It is useful if you are troubleshooting some customer sync rules and want to see the effect of a change on a single object. You can select between **Full Sync** and **Delta sync**. You can also select between **Generate Preview**, which will only keep the change in memory, and **Commit Preview**, which will stage all changes to target connector spaces.
![Sync Service Manager](./media/active-directory-aadconnectsync-service-manager-ui/preview1.png)
You can inspect the object and which rule applied for a particular attribute flow.
![Sync Service Manager](./media/active-directory-aadconnectsync-service-manager-ui/preview2.png)

**Log**  
The Log page is used to see the password sync status and history, see [Troubleshoot password synchronization](active-directory-aadconnectsync-implement-password-synchronization.md#troubleshoot-password-synchronization) for more information.

### Metaverse Object Properties
**Attributes**  
On the attributes tab you can see the values and which Connector contributed it.
![Sync Service Manager](./media/active-directory-aadconnectsync-service-manager-ui/mvattributes.png)
**Connectors**  
The Connectors tab shows all connector spaces which have a representation of the object.
![Sync Service Manager](./media/active-directory-aadconnectsync-service-manager-ui/mvconnectors.png)
This tab also allows you to navigate to the [connector space object](#connector-space-object-properties).
