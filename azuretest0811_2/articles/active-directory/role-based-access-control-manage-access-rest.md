# Managing Role-Based Access Control with the REST API
> [!div class="op_single_selector"]
> * [PowerShell](role-based-access-control-manage-access-powershell.md)

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in the Azure Portal and Azure Resource Manager API helps you manage access to your subscription and resources at a fine-grained level. With this feature, you can grant access for Active Directory users, groups, or service principals by assigning some roles to them at a particular scope.

## List all role assignments
Lists all the role assignments at the specified scope and subscopes.

To list role assignments, you must have access to `Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/read` operation at the scope. All the built-in roles are granted access to this operation. For more information about role assignments and managing access for Azure resources, see [Azure Role-Based Access Control](role-based-access-control-configure.md).

### Request
Use the **GET** method with the following URI:

    https://management.azure.com/{scope}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments?api-version={api-version}&$filter={filter}

Within the URI, make the following substitutions to customize your request:

1. Replace *{scope}* with the scope for which you wish to list the role assignments. The following examples show how to specify the scope for different levels:
   
   * Subscription: /subscriptions/{subscription-id}  
   * Resource Group: /subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/myresourcegroup1  
   * Resource: /subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/myresourcegroup1/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/mysite1  
2. Replace *{api-version}* with 2015-07-01.
3. Replace *{filter}* with the condition that you wish to apply to filter the role assignment list:
   
   * List role assignments for only the specified scope, not including the role assignments at subscopes: `atScope()`    
   * List role assignments for a specific user, group, or application: `principalId%20eq%20'{objectId of user, group, or service principal}'`  
   * List role assignments for a specific user, including ones inherited from groups | `assignedTo('{objectId of user}')`

### Response
Status code: 200

## Get information about a role assignment
Gets information about a single role assignment specified by the role assignment identifier.

To get information about a role assignment, you must have access to `Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/read` operation. All the built-in roles are granted access to this operation. For more information about role assignments and managing access for Azure resources, see [Azure Role-Based Access Control](role-based-access-control-configure.md).

Within the URI, make the following substitutions to customize your request:

1. Replace *{scope}* with the scope at which you wish to create the role assignments. When you create a role assignment at a parent scope, all child scopes inherit the same role assignment. The following examples show how to specify the scope for different levels:
   
   * Subscription: /subscriptions/{subscription-id}  
   * Resource Group: /subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/myresourcegroup1   
   * Resource: /subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/myresourcegroup1/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/mysite1

## Create a Custom Role
Create a custom role.

To create a custom role, you must have access to `Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/write` operation on all the `AssignableScopes`. Of the built-in roles, only *Owner* and *User Access Administrator* are granted access to this operation. For more information about role assignments and managing access for Azure resources, see [Azure Role-Based Access Control](role-based-access-control-configure.md).

### Request
Use the **PUT** method with the following URI:

    https://management.azure.com/{scope}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/{role-definition-id}?api-version={api-version}

Within the URI, make the following substitutions to customize your request:

1. Replace *{scope}* with the first *AssignableScope* of the custom role. The following examples show how to specify the scope for different levels.
   
   * Subscription: /subscriptions/{subscription-id}  
   * Resource Group: /subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/myresourcegroup1  
   * Resource: /subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/myresourcegroup1/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/mysite1  
2. Replace *{role-definition-id}* with a new GUID, which becomes the GUID identifier of the new custom role.
3. Replace *{api-version}* with 2015-07-01.

For the request body, provide the values in the following format:

## Update a Custom Role
Modify a custom role.

To modify a custom role, you must have access to `Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/write` operation on all the `AssignableScopes`. Of the built-in roles, only *Owner* and *User Access Administrator* are granted access to this operation. For more information about role assignments and managing access for Azure resources, see [Azure Role-Based Access Control](role-based-access-control-configure.md).

### Request
Use the **PUT** method with the following URI:

    https://management.azure.com/{scope}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/{role-definition-id}?api-version={api-version}

Within the URI, make the following substitutions to customize your request:

1. Replace *{scope}* with the first *AssignableScope* of the custom role. The following examples show how to specify the scope for different levels:
   
   * Subscription: /subscriptions/{subscription-id}  
   * Resource Group: /subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/myresourcegroup1  
   * Resource: /subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/myresourcegroup1/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/mysite1  
2. Replace *{role-definition-id}* with the GUID identifier of the custom role.
3. Replace *{api-version}* with 2015-07-01.

For the request body, provide the values in the following format:

```
