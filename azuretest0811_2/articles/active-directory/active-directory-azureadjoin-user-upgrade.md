# Set up a Windows 10 device with Azure AD from Settings
If you are already using Windows 7 or Windows 8, and your computer or device has been upgraded to Windows 10, you can join to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) through the Settings menu.

## To join to Azure AD from the Settings menu
1. From the **Start** menu, click the **Settings** charm.
2. From **Settings**, select     **System**->**About**->**Join Azure AD**.
   
   <center>
   ![Join Azure AD from the Settings menu](./media/active-directory-azureadjoin/active-directory-azureadjoin-settings.png) </center>
3. Click **Continue** in the Azure AD Join message window.

4. Provide your sign-in credentials. This sign-in experience will include all the steps that are required to complete authentication. If you are part of a federated tenant, your administrator will provide you with the federation experience that's hosted by your organization.

5. If your organization has configured Azure Multi-Factor Authentication for joining to Azure AD, provide the second factor before proceeding.
6. Click **Accept** on the **Allow this device to be managed** screen.
7. You should see the message "Your device is now joined to your organization in Azure AD".
