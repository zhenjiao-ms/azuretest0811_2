Xamarin allows you to write mobile apps in C# that can run on iOS, Android, and Windows (mobile devices and PCs). If you're building an app using Xamarin, Azure AD makes it simple and straightforward for you to authenticate your users with their Active Directory accounts. It also enables your application to securely consume any web API protected by Azure AD, such as the Office 365 APIs or the Azure API.

For Xamarin apps that need to access protected resources, Azure AD provides the Active Directory Authentication Library, or ADAL. ADAL’s sole purpose in life is to make it easy for your app to get access tokens. To demonstrate just how easy it is, here we’ll build a "Directory Searcher" app that:

* Runs on iOS, Android, Windows Desktop, Windows Phone, and Windows Store.
* Uses a single portable class library (PCL) to authenticate users and get tokens for the Azure AD Graph API
* Searches a directory for users with a given UPN.

To build the complete working application, you’ll need to:

1. Set up your Xamarin development environment
2. Register your application with Azure AD.
3. Install & Configure ADAL.
4. Use ADAL to get tokens from Azure AD.

To get started, [download a skeleton project](https://github.com/AzureADQuickStarts/NativeClient-MultiTarget-DotNet/archive/skeleton.zip) or [download the completed sample](https://github.com/AzureADQuickStarts/NativeClient-MultiTarget-DotNet/archive/complete.zip). Each is a Visual Studio 2013 solution. You'll also need an Azure AD tenant in which you can create users and register an application. If you don't already have a tenant, [learn how to get one](active-directory-howto-tenant.md).

## *0. Set up your Xamarin Development Environment*
Because this tutorial includes projects for iOS, Android, and Windows, you’ll need Visual Studio and Xamarin together. To create the necessary environment, follow the complete instructions on [Setup and Install for Visual Studio and Xamarin](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt613162.aspx) on MSDN. Those instructions include material you can review to learn more about Xamarin while you're waiting for the installers to complete. 

Once you've completed the necessary setup, open the solution in Visual Studio to get started. You will find six projects: five platform-specific projects and one portable class library that will be shared across all platforms, `DirectorySearcher.cs`

## *1. Register the Directory Searcher Application*
To enable your app to get tokens, you’ll first need to register it in your Azure AD tenant and grant it permission to access the Azure AD Graph API:

* Sign into the [Azure Management Portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com)
* In the left hand nav, click on **Active Directory**
* Select a tenant in which to register the application.
* Click the **Applications** tab, and click **Add** in the bottom drawer.
* Follow the prompts and create a new **Native Client Application**.
  * The **Name** of the application will describe your application to end-users
  * The **Redirect Uri** is a scheme and string combination that Azure AD will use to return token responses. Enter a value, e.g. `http://DirectorySearcher`.
* Once you’ve completed registration, AAD will assign your app a unique client identifier. You’ll need this value in the next sections, so copy it from the **Configure** tab.
* Also in **Configure** tab, locate the "Permissions to Other Applications" section. For the "Azure Active Directory" application, add the **Access Your Organization's Directory** permission under **Delegated Permissions**. This will enable your application to query the Graph API for users.

## *2. Install & Configure ADAL*
Now that you have an application in Azure AD, you can install ADAL and write your identity-related code. In order for ADAL to be able to communicate with Azure AD, you need to provide it with some information about your app registration.

* Begin by adding ADAL to each of the projects in the solution using the Package Manager Console.

`
PM> Install-Package Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory -ProjectName DirectorySearcherLib
`

`
PM> Install-Package Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory -ProjectName DirSearchClient-Android
`

`
PM> Install-Package Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory -ProjectName DirSearchClient-Desktop
`

`
PM> Install-Package Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory -ProjectName DirSearchClient-iOS
`

`
PM> Install-Package Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory -ProjectName DirSearchClient-Universal
`

* You should notice that two library references are added to each project - the PCL portion of ADAL and a platform-specific portion.
* In the DirectorySearcherLib project, open `DirectorySearcher.cs`. Change the class member values to reflect the values you input into the Azure Portal. Your code will reference these values whenever it uses ADAL.
  
  * The `tenant` is the domain of your Azure AD tenant, e.g. contoso.onmicrosoft.com
  * The `clientId` is the clientId of your application you copied from the portal.
  * The `returnUri` is the redirectUri you entered in the portal, e.g. `http://DirectorySearcher`.

## *3.    Use ADAL to Get Tokens from AAD*
*Almost* all of the app's authentication logic lies in `DirectorySearcher.SearchByAlias(...)`. All that is necessary in the platform-specific projects is to pass a contextual parameter to the `DirectorySearcher` PCL.

* First, open `DirectorySearcher.cs` and add a new parameter to the `SearchByAlias(...)` method. `IPlatformParameters` is the contextual parameter that encapsulates the platform-specific objects that ADAL needs to perform authentication.

```C#
public static async Task<List<User>> SearchByAlias(string alias, IPlatformParameters parent)
{
```

* Next, initialize the `AuthenticationContext` - ADAL’s primary class. This is where you pass ADAL the coordinates it needs to communicate with Azure AD. Then call `AcquireTokenAsync(...)`, which accepts the `IPlatformParameters` object and will invoke the authentication flow necessary to return a token to the app.

```C#
...
    AuthenticationResult authResult = null;
    try
    {
        AuthenticationContext authContext = new AuthenticationContext(authority);
        authResult = await authContext.AcquireTokenAsync(graphResourceUri, clientId, returnUri, parent);
    }
    catch (Exception ee)
    {
        results.Add(new User { error = ee.Message });
        return results;
    }
...
```
* `AcquireTokenAsync(...)` will first attempt to return a token for the requested resource (the Graph API in this case) without prompting the user to enter their credentials (via caching or refreshing old tokens). Only if necessary, it will show the user the Azure AD sign in page before acquiring the requested token.
* You can then attach the access token to the Graph API request in the Authorization header:

```C#
...
    request.Headers.Authorization = new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", authResult.AccessToken);
...
```

That's all for the `DirectorySearcher` PCL and your app's identity-related code.  All that remains is to call the `SearchByAlias(...)` method in each platform's views, and where necessary add code for correctly handling the UI lifecycle.

#### Android:
* In `MainActivity.cs`, add a call to `SearchByAlias(...)` in the button click handler:

```C#
List<User> results = await DirectorySearcher.SearchByAlias(searchTermText.Text, new PlatformParameters(this));
```
* You also need to override the `OnActivityResult` lifecycle method to forward any authentication redirects back to the appropriate method.  ADAL provides a helper method for this in Android:

```C#
...
protected override void OnActivityResult(int requestCode, Result resultCode, Intent data)
{
    base.OnActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);
    AuthenticationAgentContinuationHelper.SetAuthenticationAgentContinuationEventArgs(requestCode, resultCode, data);
}
...
```

#### Windows Desktop:
* In `MainWindow.xaml.cs`, simply make a call to `SearchByAlias(...)` passing a `WindowInteropHelper` in the desktop's `PlatformParameters` object:

```C#
List<User> results = await DirectorySearcher.SearchByAlias(
  SearchTermText.Text,
  new PlatformParameters(PromptBehavior.Auto, this.Handle));
```

#### iOS:
* In `DirSearchClient_iOSViewController.cs`, the iOS `PlatformParameters` object simply takes a reference to the View Controller:

```C#
List<User> results = await DirectorySearcher.SearchByAlias(
  SearchTermText.Text,
  new PlatformParameters(PromptBehavior.Auto, this.Handle));
```

#### Windows Universal:
* In Windows Universal, open `MainPage.xaml.cs` and implement the `Search` method, which uses a helper method in a shared project to update UI as necessary.

```C#
...
    List<User> results = await DirectorySearcherLib.DirectorySearcher.SearchByAlias(SearchTermText.Text, new PlatformParameters(PromptBehavior.Auto, false));
...
```

Congratulations! You now have a working Xamarin app that has the ability to authenticate users and securely call Web APIs using OAuth 2.0 across five different platforms. If you haven’t already, now is the time to populate your tenant with some users. Run your DirectorySearcher app, and sign in with one of those users. Search for other users based on their UPN.

ADAL makes it easy to incorporate common identity features into your app. It takes care of all the dirty work for you - cache management, OAuth protocol support, presenting the user with a login UI, refreshing expired tokens, and more. All you really need to know is a single API call, `authContext.AcquireToken*(…)`.

For reference, the completed sample (without your configuration values) is provided [here](https://github.com/AzureADQuickStarts/NativeClient-MultiTarget-DotNet/archive/complete.zip). You can now move on to additional identity scenarios. You may want to try:
