# Sign-in Microsoft Account & Azure AD users in a single app
In the past, an app developer who wanted to support both Microsoft accounts and Azure Active Directory was required to integrate with two separate systems.  We've now introduced a new authentication API version that enables you to sign in users in with both types of accounts using the Azure AD system.  This converged authentication system is known as **the v2.0 endpoint**.  With the v2.0 endpoint, one simple integration allows you to reach an audience that spans millions of users with both personal and work/school accounts.

Apps that use the v2.0 endpoint can also consume REST APIs from the [Microsoft Graph](https://graph.microsoft.io) and [Office 365](https://msdn.microsoft.com/office/office365/howto/authenticate-Office-365-APIs-using-v2) using either type of account.

<!-- For a quick introduction to the v2.0 endpoint, please view the [Getting Started with Microsoft Identities: Enterprise Grade Sign In For Your Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/videos/build-2016-getting-started-with-microsoft-identities-enterprise-grade-sign-in-for-your-apps/) video. -->

## Getting Started
[!VIDEO https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2016/P530/player]


Choose your favorite platform below to build an app using our open source libraries & frameworks.  Alternatively, you can use our OAuth 2.0 & OpenID Connect protocol documentation to send & receive protocol messages directly without using an auth library.

## What's New
The conceptual information here will be useful in understanding what is & what isn't possible with the v2.0 endpoint.

* If you built an app during the v2.0 endpoint 2015 preview period, be sure to [read about these breaking protocol changes](active-directory-v2-preview-oidc-changes.md) that we recently made.
* Learn about the [types of apps you can build with the v2.0 endpoint](active-directory-v2-flows.md).
* For developers familiar with Azure Active Directory, you should check out the [updates to our protocols & differences in the v2.0 endpoint](active-directory-v2-compare.md).
* Understand the [limitations, restrictions and constraints](active-directory-v2-limitations.md) with the v2.0 endpoint.
