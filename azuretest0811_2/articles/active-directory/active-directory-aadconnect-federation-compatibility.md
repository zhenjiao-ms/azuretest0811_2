# Azure AD federation compatibility list
Azure Active Directory provides single-sign on and enhanced application access security for Office 365 and other Microsoft Online services for hybrid and cloud-only implementations without requiring any non-Microsoft solution. Office 365, like most of Microsoft’s Online services, is integrated with Azure Active Directory for directory services, authentication and authorization. Azure Active Directory also provides single sign-on to thousands of SaaS applications and on-premises web applications. Please see the Azure Active Directory application gallery for supported SaaS applications.

For organizations that have invested in non-Microsoft federation solutions, this topic contains guidance for configuring single sign-on for their Windows Server Active Directory users with Microsoft Online services by using non-Microsoft identity providers from the “Azure Active Directory federation compatibility list” below. 

![](./media/active-directory-aadconnect-federation-compatibility/oxford2.jpg)   
[Oxford Computer Group](http://oxfordcomputergroup.com/), a third-party, on behalf of Microsoft, tested these single sign-on experiences using non-Microsoft identity providers against a set of use cases common with Azure Active Directory.

For information on how you can get your third-party identity provider listed here, contact Oxford Computer Group at [idp@oxfordcomputergroup.com](mailto:idp@oxfordcomputergroup.com).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Oxford Computer Group tested only the federation functionality of these single sign-on scenarios. Oxford Computer Group did not perform any testing of the synchronization, two-factor authentication, etc. components of these single sign-on scenarios.
> 
> Use of Sign-in by Alternate ID to UPN is also not tested in this program.
