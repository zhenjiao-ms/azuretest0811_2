# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Facebook at Work
The objective of this tutorial is to show you how to integrate Facebook at Work with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

Integrating Facebook at Work with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits: 

* You can control in Azure AD who has access to Facebook at Work 
* You can automatically provision account for users who have been granted access to Facebook at Work
* You can enable your users to automatically get signed-on to Facebook at Work (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts
* You can manage your accounts in one central location 

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis.md).

## Prerequisites
To configure Azure AD integration with CS Stars, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription
* Facebook at Work with single sign on enabled

To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

* You should not use your production environment, unless this is necessary.
* If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can get a one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/). 

## Adding Facebook at Work from the gallery
To configure the integration of Facebook at Work into Azure AD, you need to add Facebook at Work from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add Facebook at Work from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **Azure classic portal**, on the left navigation pane, click **Active Directory**. 
   
    ![Active Directory](./media/active-directory-saas-cs-stars-tutorial/tutorial_general_01.png)
2. From the **Directory** list, select the directory for which you want to enable directory integration.
3. To open the applications view, in the directory view, click **Applications** in the top menu.
   
    ![Applications](./media/active-directory-saas-cs-stars-tutorial/tutorial_general_02.png)
4. Click **Add** at the bottom of the page.
   
    ![Applications](./media/active-directory-saas-cs-stars-tutorial/tutorial_general_03.png)
5. On the **What do you want to do** dialog, click **Add an application from the gallery**.
   
    ![Applications](./media/active-directory-saas-cs-stars-tutorial/tutorial_general_04.png)
6. In the search box, type **Facebook at Work**.
7. In the results pane, select **Facebook at Work**, and then click **Complete** to add the application.

### Configuring Azure AD Single Sign-On
This section outlines how to enable users to authenticate to Facebook at Work with their account in Azure Active Directory, using federation based on the SAML protocol.

**To configure Azure AD single sign-on with Facebook at Work, perform the following steps:**

1. After adding Facebook at Work in the Azure classic portal, click **Configure Single Sign-On**.
2. In the **Configure App URL** screen, enter the URL where users will sign into your Facebook at Work application. This is your Facebook at Work tenant URL 
   (Example: https://example.facebook.com/). Once finished, click **Next**.
3. In a different web browser window, log into your Facebook at Work company site as an administrator.
4. Follow the instructions at the following URL to configure Facebook at Work to use Azure AD as an identity provider: [https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-at-work/authentication/cloud-providers](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-at-work/authentication/cloud-providers)
5. Once completed, return to the browser windows showing the Azure classic portal, click the checkbox to confirm you have completed the procedure, then click **Next** and **Complete**.

## Automatically provisioning users to Facebook at Work
Azure AD supports the ability to automatically synchonize the account details of assigned users to Facebook at Work. This automatic sychronization enables Facebook at Work to get the data it needs to authorize users for access, in advance of them attempting to sign-in for the first time. It also de-provisions users from Facebook at Work when access has been revoked in Azure AD.

Automatic provisioning can be set up by clicking **Configure account provisioning** in the Azure classic portal window.

For additional details on how to configure automatic provisioning, see [https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-at-work/provisioning/cloud-providers](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-at-work/provisioning/cloud-providers)

## Assigning users to Facebook at Work
For provisioned AAD users to be able to see Facebook at Work on their Access Panel, they must be assigned access inside the Azure classic portal.

**To assign users to Facebook at Work:**

1. On the start page for Facebook at Work in the Azure classic portal, click **Assign accounts**.
2. In the **Show** menu, select whether you want to assign a user or a group to Facebook at Work and click the Checkmark button.
3. In the resulting list, select the users or group to whom you want to assign Facebook at Work.
4. In the page footer, click the **Assign** button.
