# Assign users to a custom domain
After you have added your custom domain to Azure Active Directory, you must add the user accounts for this domain so that you can begin authenticating them.

## Users synced in from a directory on your corporate network
If you have already set up a connection between your on-premises Active Directory and Azure Active Directory, synchronization can populate the accounts. For more information on how to synchronize Azure Active Directory with your on-premises Active Directory, see [Integrating your on-premises identities with Azure Active Directory](active-directory-aadconnect.md).

## Users added and managed in the cloud
To change the domain for an existing user account:

1. Open the Azure classic portal using an account that is a global admin or a user admin.
2. Open your directory.
3. Select the **Users** tab.
4. Select the user from the list.
5. Change the domain for the user, and then select **Save**.

This can also be done using [Microsoft PowerShell](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/e1ef403f-3347-4409-8f46-d72dafa116e0#BKMK_ManageDomains) or the [Graph API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/Azure/Ad/Graph/api/domains-operations).

## Select a custom domain when creating a new user
1. Open the Azure classic portal using an account that is a global admin or a user admin.
2. Open your directory.
3. Select the **Users** tab.
4. In the command bar, select **Add**.
5. When you add the user name, choose the custom domain from the domain list.
6. Select **Save**.
