## Delete a server or service instance

In some instances, you may wish to remove a server from being monitored. Follow the instructions below to remove a server from Azure AD Connect Health Service.

When deleting a server, be aware of the following:

* This action will STOP collecting any further data from that server. This server will be removed from the monitoring service. After this action, you will not be able to view new alerts, monitoring or usage analytics data for this server.
* This action will NOT uninstall or remove the Health Agent from your server. If you have not uninstalled the Health Agent before performing this step, you may see error events on the server related to the Health Agent.
* This action will NOT delete the data already collected from this server. That data will be deleted as per the Microsoft Azure Data Retention Policy.
* After performing this action, if you wish to start monitoring the same server again, you will need to uninstall and re-install the health agent on this server.

## Manage Access With Role Based Access Control
### Overview
[Role Based Access Control](role-based-access-control-configure.md) for Azure AD Connect Health provides access Azure AD Connect Health service to users and/or groups outside of global administrators. This is achieved by assigning roles to the intended users and\or groups and provides a mechanism to limit the global administrators within your directory.

#### Roles
Azure AD Connect Health supports the following built-in roles.

| Role | Permissions |
| --- | --- |
| Owner |Owners can ***manage access*** (e.g. assign role to a user/group), ***view all information*** (e.g. view alerts) from the portal and ***change settings*** (e.g. email notifications) within Azure AD Connect Health. <br>By default, Azure AD global administrators are assigned this role and this cannot be changed. |
| Contributor |Contributors can ***view all information*** (e.g. view alerts) from the portal and ***change settings*** (e.g. email notifications) within Azure AD Connect Health. |
| Reader |Readers can ***view all information*** (e.g. view alerts) from the portal within Azure AD Connect Health. |

All other roles (such as ‘User Access Administrators’ or ‘DevTest Labs Users’), even if available in the portal experience, have no impact to access within Azure AD Connect Health.

#### Access Scope
Azure AD Connect supports managing access at two levels:

* ***All service instances***: This is the recommended path for most customers and controls access for all service instances (e.g. an ADFS farm) across all role types that are being monitored by Azure AD Connect Health.
* ***Service Instance***: In some cases, you may need to segregate access based on role types or by a service instance. In this case, you can manage access at the service instance level.  

Permission is granted if an end user has access either at the Directory or Service Instance level.

### How to allow users or groups access to Azure AD Connect Health
#### Steps 1: Select the appropriate access scope

#### Step 2: Add users, groups and assign roles
1. Click on the "Users" part from the Configure section.<br>
   ![Azure AD Connect Health RBAC Main Blade](./media/active-directory-aadconnect-health/RBAC_main_blade.png)
2. Select "Add"
3. Select the "Role" such as "Owner"<br>
   ![Azure AD Connect Health RBAC Add User ](./media/active-directory-aadconnect-health/RBAC_add.png)

   ![Azure AD Connect Health RBAC Select User](./media/active-directory-aadconnect-health/RBAC_select_users.png)

6. Once the role assignment is complete, the users and/or groups will appear in the list.<br>
   ![Azure AD Connect Health RBAC User List](./media/active-directory-aadconnect-health/RBAC_user_list.png)

These steps will allow the listed users and group access as per their assigned roles.

> [!NOTE]
> * Global Administrators always have full access to all the operations but global administrator accounts will not be present in the above list.
> * "Invite Users" feature is NOT supported within Azure AD Connect Health.
>

#### Step 3: Share the blade location with users or groups
1. After assigning permissions, a user can access Azure AD Connect Health by going to [http://aka.ms/aadconnecthealth](http://aka.ms/aadconnecthealth).
2. Once on the blade, the user can pin the blade or different parts to the dashboard by simply clicking "Pin to dashboard"<br>
   ![Azure AD Connect Health RBAC pin blade](./media/active-directory-aadconnect-health/RBAC_pin_blade.png)

> [!NOTE]
> A user with the "Reader" role assigned will not be able to perform the "create" operation to get Azure AD Connect Health extension from the Azure Marketplace. This user can still get to the blade by going to the above link. For subsequent usage, the user can pin the blade to the dashboard.
> 
> 

### Remove users and/or groups
