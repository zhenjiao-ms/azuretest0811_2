# Join a personal device to your organization
## To join a Windows 10 device to your organization
1. From the **Start** menu, select **Settings**.
2. Select **Accounts**, and then click **Your account**.
3. Click **Add Work or School account**, and then type in your organizational account.
4. On the sign-in page for your organization, enter your user name and password, and then click **OK**.
5. You will be prompted for a multi-factor authentication challenge. (This challenge is configurable by an IT administrator.)
6. Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) checks whether the device requires mobile device management enrollment.
7. Windows registers the device in the organizationâ€™s directory in Azure AD and enrolls it in mobile device management, if appropriate.
8. If you are a managed user, Windows takes you to the desktop through the automatic sign-in.
9. If you are a federated user, you will be taken to a Windows sign-in screen to enter your credentials.
