# Azure AD Connect sync: How to manage the Azure AD service account
The service account used by the Azure AD Connector is supposed to be service free. But if you need to reset its credentials, then this topic is for you. This can for example happen if a Global Administrator has by mistake reset the password on the service account using PowerShell.

## Reset the credentials
If the service account defined on the Azure AD Connector cannot contact Azure AD due to authentication problems, the password can be reset.

1. Sign-in to the Azure AD Connect sync server and start PowerShell.
2. Run `Add-ADSyncAADServiceAccount`.  
   ![PowerShell cmdlet addadsyncaadserviceaccount](./media/active-directory-aadconnectsync-howto-azureadaccount/addadsyncaadserviceaccount.png)
3. Provide Azure AD Global admin credentials.

This cmdlet will reset the password for the service account and update it both in Azure AD and in the sync engine.
