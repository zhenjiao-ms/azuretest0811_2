# Authorize access to web applications using OAuth 2.0 and Azure Active Directory
Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) uses OAuth 2.0 to enable you to authorize access to web applications and web APIs in your Azure AD tenant. This guide is language independent, and describes how to send and receive HTTP messages without using any of our open-source libraries.

The OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow is described in [section 4.1 of the OAuth 2.0 specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1) . It is used to perform authentication and authorization in the majority of app types, including web apps and natively installed apps.

[!INCLUDE [active-directory-protocols-getting-started](../../includes/active-directory-protocols-getting-started.md)]

## OAuth 2.0 authorization flow
At a high level, the entire authorization flow for an application looks a bit like this:

![OAuth Auth Code Flow](media/active-directory-protocols-oauth-code/active-directory-oauth-code-flow-native-app.png)

## Request an authorization code
The authorization code flow begins with the client directing the user to the `/authorize` endpoint. In this request, the client indicates the permissions it needs to acquire from the user. You can get the OAuth 2.0 endpoints from your application's page in Azure Classic Portal, in the **View Endpoints** button in the bottom drawer.

```
// Line breaks for legibility only

https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant}/oauth2/authorize?
client_id=6731de76-14a6-49ae-97bc-6eba6914391e
&response_type=code
&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%2Fmyapp%2F
&response_mode=query
&resource=https%3A%2F%2Fservice.contoso.com%2F
&state=12345
```

| Parameter |  | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| tenant |required |The `{tenant}` value in the path of the request can be used to control who can sign into the application.  The allowed values are tenant identifiers, e.g. `8eaef023-2b34-4da1-9baa-8bc8c9d6a490` or `contoso.onmicrosoft.com` or `common` for tenant-independent tokens |
| client_id |required |The Application Id assigned to your app when you registered it with Azure AD. You can find this in the Azure Management Portal. Click on **Active Directory**, click the directory, click on the application and then click on **Configure** |
| response_type |required |Must include `code` for the authorization code flow. |
| redirect_uri |recommended |The redirect_uri of your app, where authentication responses can be sent and received by your app.  It must exactly match one of the redirect_uris you registered in the portal, except it must be url encoded.  For native & mobile apps, you should use the default value of `urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob`. |
| response_mode |recommended |Specifies the method that should be used to send the resulting token back to your app.  Can be `query` or `form_post`. |
| state |recommended |A value included in the request that will also be returned in the token response. A randomly generated unique value is typically used for [preventing cross-site request forgery attacks](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-10.12).  The state is also used to encode information about the user's state in the app before the authentication request occurred, such as the page or view they were on. |
| resource |optional |The App ID URI of the web API (secured resource). To find the App ID URI of the web API, in the Azure Management Portal, click **Active Directory**, click the directory, click the application and then click **Configure**. |
| prompt |optional |Indicate the type of user interaction that is required.<p> Valid values are: <p> *login*: The user should be prompted to re-authenticate. <p> *consent*: User consent has been granted, but needs to be updated. The user should be prompted to consent. <p> *admin_consent*: An administrator should be prompted to consent on behalf of all users in their organization |
| login_hint |optional |Can be used to pre-fill the username/email address field of the sign in page for the user, if you know their username ahead of time.  Often apps will use this parameter during re-authentication, having already extracted the username from a previous sign-in using the `preferred_username` claim. |
| domain_hint |optional |Provides a hint about the tenant or domain that the user should use to sign in. The value of the domain_hint is a registered domain for the tenant. If the tenant is federated to an on-premises directory, AAD redirects to the specified tenant federation server. |

> [!NOTE]
> If the user is part of an organization, an administrator of the organization can consent or decline on the user's behalf, or permit the user to consent. The user is given the option to consent only when the administrator permits it.
> 
> 

At this point, the user will be asked to enter their credentials and consent to the permissions indicated in the `scope` query parameter. Once the user authenticates and grants consent, Azure AD sends a response to your app at the `redirect_uri` address in your request.

### Successful response
A successful response could look like this:

```
GET  HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Location: http://localhost/myapp/?code= AwABAAAAvPM1KaPlrEqdFSBzjqfTGBCmLdgfSTLEMPGYuNHSUYBrqqf_ZT_p5uEAEJJ_nZ3UmphWygRNy2C3jJ239gV_DBnZ2syeg95Ki-374WHUP-i3yIhv5i-7KU2CEoPXwURQp6IVYMw-DjAOzn7C3JCu5wpngXmbZKtJdWmiBzHpcO2aICJPu1KvJrDLDP20chJBXzVYJtkfjviLNNW7l7Y3ydcHDsBRKZc3GuMQanmcghXPyoDg41g8XbwPudVh7uCmUponBQpIhbuffFP_tbV8SNzsPoFz9CLpBCZagJVXeqWoYMPe2dSsPiLO9Alf_YIe5zpi-zY4C3aLw5g9at35eZTfNd0gBRpR5ojkMIcZZ6IgAA&session_state=7B29111D-C220-4263-99AB-6F6E135D75EF&state=D79E5777-702E-4260-9A62-37F75FF22CCE
```

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| admin_consent |The value is True if an administrator consented to a consent request prompt. |
| code |The authorization code that the application requested. The application can use the authorization code to request an access token for the target resource. |
| session_state |A unique value that identifies the current user session. This value is a GUID, but should be treated as an opaque value that is passed without examination. |
| state |If a state parameter is included in the request, the same value should appear in the response. It's a good practice for the application to verify that the state values in the request and response are identical before using the response. This helps to detect [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-10.12) against the client.   |

### Error response
Error responses may also be sent to the `redirect_uri` so that the application can handle them appropriately.

```
GET http://localhost:12345/?
error=access_denied
&error_description=the+user+canceled+the+authentication
```

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| error |An error code value defined in Section 5.2 of the [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749). The next table describes the error codes that Azure AD returns. |
| error_description |A more detailed description of the error. This message is not intended to be end-user friendly. |
| state |The state value is a randomly generated non-reused value that is sent in the request and returned in the response to prevent cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks. |

#### Error codes for authorization endpoint errors
The following table describes the various error codes that can be returned in the `error` parameter of the error response.

| Error Code | Description | Client Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| invalid_request |Protocol error, such as a missing required parameter. |Fix and resubmit the request. This is a development error is typically caught during initial testing. |
| unauthorized_client |The client application is not permitted to request an authorization code. |This usually occurs when the client application is not registered in Azure AD or is not added to the user's Azure AD tenant. The application can prompt the user with instruction for installing the application and adding it to Azure AD. |
| access_denied |Resource owner denied consent |The client application can notify the user that it cannot proceed unless the user consents. |
| unsupported_response_type |The authorization server does not support the response type in the request. |Fix and resubmit the request. This is a development error is typically caught during initial testing. |
| server_error |The server encountered an unexpected error. |Retry the request. These errors can result from temporary conditions. The client application might explain to the user that its response is delayed due a temporary error. |
| temporarily_unavailable |The server is temporarily too busy to handle the request. |Retry the request. The client application might explain to the user that its response is delayed due a temporary condition. |
| invalid_resource |The target resource is invalid because it does not exist, Azure AD cannot find it, or it is not correctly configured. |This indicates the resource, if it exists, has not been configured in the tenant. The application can prompt the user with instruction for installing the application and adding it to Azure AD. |

## Use the authorization code to request an access token
Now that you've acquired an authorization code and have been granted permission by the user, you can redeem the code for an access token to the desired resource, by sending a POST request to the `/token` endpoint:

```
// Line breaks for legibility only

POST /{tenant}/oauth2/token HTTP/1.1
Host: https://login.microsoftonline.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
grant_type=authorization_code
&client_id=2d4d11a2-f814-46a7-890a-274a72a7309e
&code=AwABAAAAvPM1KaPlrEqdFSBzjqfTGBCmLdgfSTLEMPGYuNHSUYBrqqf_ZT_p5uEAEJJ_nZ3UmphWygRNy2C3jJ239gV_DBnZ2syeg95Ki-374WHUP-i3yIhv5i-7KU2CEoPXwURQp6IVYMw-DjAOzn7C3JCu5wpngXmbZKtJdWmiBzHpcO2aICJPu1KvJrDLDP20chJBXzVYJtkfjviLNNW7l7Y3ydcHDsBRKZc3GuMQanmcghXPyoDg41g8XbwPudVh7uCmUponBQpIhbuffFP_tbV8SNzsPoFz9CLpBCZagJVXeqWoYMPe2dSsPiLO9Alf_YIe5zpi-zY4C3aLw5g9at35eZTfNd0gBRpR5ojkMIcZZ6IgAA
&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%2Fmyapp%2F
&resource=https%3A%2F%2Fservice.contoso.com%2F
&client_secret=p@ssw0rd

//NOTE: client_secret only required for web apps
```

| Parameter |  | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| tenant |required |The `{tenant}` value in the path of the request can be used to control who can sign into the application.  The allowed values are tenant identifiers, e.g. `8eaef023-2b34-4da1-9baa-8bc8c9d6a490` or `contoso.onmicrosoft.com` or `common` for tenant-independent tokens |
| client_id |required |The Application Id assigned to your app when you registered it with Azure AD. You can find this in the Azure Classic Portal. Click on **Active Directory**, click the directory, click on the application and then click on **Configure** |
| grant_type |required |Must be `authorization_code` for the authorization code flow. |
| code |required |The `authorization_code` that you acquired in the previous section |
| redirect_uri |required |The same `redirect_uri` value that was used to acquire the `authorization_code`. |
| client_secret |required for web apps |The application secret that you created in the app registration portal for your app.  It should not be used in a native app, because client_secrets cannot be reliably stored on devices.  It is required for web apps and web APIs, which have the ability to store the `client_secret` securely on the server side. |
| resource |required if specified in authorization code request, else optional |The App ID URI of the web API (secured resource). |

To find the App ID URI, in the Azure Management Portal, click **Active Directory**, click the directory, click the application, and then click **Configure**.

### Successful response
Azure AD returns an access token upon a successful response. To minimize network calls from the client application and their associated latency, the client application should cache access tokens for the token lifetime that is specified in the OAuth 2.0 response. To determine the token lifetime, use either the `expires_in` or `expires_on` parameter values.

If a web API resource returns an `invalid_token` error code, this might indicate that the resource has determined that the token is expired. If the client and resource clock times are different (known as a "time skew"), the resource might consider the token to be expired before the token is cleared from the client cache. If this occurs, clear the token from the cache, even if it is still within its calculated lifetime.

A successful response could look like this:

```

}

```

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| access_token |The requested access token. The  app can use this token to authenticate to the secured resource, such as a web API. |
| token_type |Indicates the token type value. The only type that Azure AD supports is Bearer. For more information about Bearer tokens, see [OAuth2.0 Authorization Framework: Bearer Token Usage (RFC 6750)](http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6750.txt) |
| expires_in |How long the access token is valid (in seconds). |
| expires_on |The time when the access token expires. The date is represented as the number of seconds from 1970-01-01T0:0:0Z UTC until the expiration time. This value is used to determine the lifetime of cached tokens. |
| resource |The App ID URI of the web API (secured resource). |
| scope |Impersonation permissions granted to the client application. The default permission is `user_impersonation`. The owner of the secured resource can register additional values in Azure AD. |
| refresh_token |An OAuth 2.0 refresh token. The  app can use this token to acquire additional access tokens after the current access token expires.  Refresh tokens are long-lived, and can be used to retain access to resources for extended periods of time. |
| id_token |An unsigned JSON Web Token (JWT). The app can base64Url decode the segments of this token to request information about the user who signed in. The  app can cache the values and display them, but it should not rely on them for any authorization or security boundaries. |

### JWT Token Claims
The JWT token in the value of the `id_token` parameter can be decoded into the following claims:

```
{
 "typ": "JWT",
 "alg": "none"
}.
{
 "aud": "2d4d11a2-f814-46a7-890a-274a72a7309e",
 "iss": "https://sts.windows.net/7fe81447-da57-4385-becb-6de57f21477e/",
 "iat": 1388440863,
 "nbf": 1388440863,
 "exp": 1388444763,
 "ver": "1.0",
 "tid": "7fe81447-da57-4385-becb-6de57f21477e",
 "oid": "68389ae2-62fa-4b18-91fe-53dd109d74f5",
 "upn": "frank@contoso.com",
 "unique_name": "frank@contoso.com",
 "sub": "JWvYdCWPhhlpS1Zsf7yYUxShUwtUm5yzPmw_-jX3fHY",
 "family_name": "Miller",
 "given_name": "Frank"
}.
```

The `id_token` parameter includes the following claim types. For more information about JSON web tokens, please see the [JWT IETF draft specification](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=392344). For more information about the token types and claims, please read [Supported Token and Claim Types](active-directory-token-and-claims.md)

| Claim type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| aud |Audience of the token. When the token is issued to a client application, the audience is the `client_id` of the client. |
| exp |Expiration time. The time when the token expires. For the token to be valid, the current date/time must be less than or equal to the `exp` value. The time is represented as the number of seconds from January 1, 1970 (1970-01-01T0:0:0Z) UTC until the time the token was issued. |
| family_name |User’s last name or surname. The application can display this value. |
| given_name |User’s first name. The application can display this value. |
| iat |Issued at time. The time when the JWT was issued. The time is represented as the number of seconds from January 1, 1970 (1970-01-01T0:0:0Z) UTC until the time the token was issued. |
| iss |Identifies the token issuer |
| nbf |Not before time. The time when the token becomes effective. For the token to be valid, the current date/time must be greater than or equal to the Nbf value. The time is represented as the number of seconds from January 1, 1970 (1970-01-01T0:0:0Z) UTC until the time the token was issued. |
| oid |Object identifier (ID) of the user object in Azure AD. |
| sub |Token subject identifier. This is a persistent and immutable identifier for the user that the token describes. Use this value in caching logic. |
| tid |Tenant identifier (ID) of the Azure AD tenant that issued the token. |
| unique_name |A unique identifier for that can be displayed to the user. This is usually a user principal name (UPN). |
| upn |User principal name of the user. |
| ver |Version. The version of the JWT token, typically 1.0. |

### Error response
The token issuance endpoint errors are HTTP error codes, because the client calls the token issuance endpoint directly. In addition to the HTTP status code, the Azure AD token issuance endpoint also returns a JSON document with objects that describe the error.

A sample error response could look like this:

```
{
  "error": "invalid_grant",
  "error_description": "AADSTS70002: Error validating credentials. AADSTS70008: The provided authorization code or refresh token is expired. Send a new interactive authorization request for this user and resource.\r\nTrace ID: 3939d04c-d7ba-42bf-9cb7-1e5854cdce9e\r\nCorrelation ID: a8125194-2dc8-4078-90ba-7b6592a7f231\r\nTimestamp: 2016-04-11 18:00:12Z",
  "error_codes": [
    70002,
    70008
  ],
  "timestamp": "2016-04-11 18:00:12Z",
  "trace_id": "3939d04c-d7ba-42bf-9cb7-1e5854cdce9e",
  "correlation_id": "a8125194-2dc8-4078-90ba-7b6592a7f231"
}
```
| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| error |An error code string that can be used to classify types of errors that occur, and can be used to react to errors. |
| error_description |A specific error message that can help a developer identify the root cause of an authentication error. |
| error_codes |A list of STS specific error codes that can help in diagnostics. |
| timestamp |The time at which the error occurred. |
| trace_id |A unique identifier for the request that can help in diagnostics. |
| correlation_id |A unique identifier for the request that can help in diagnostics across components. |

#### HTTP status codes
The following table lists the HTTP status codes that the token issuance endpoint returns. In some cases, the error code is sufficient to describe the response, but in case of errors, you will need to parse the accompanying JSON document and examine its error code.

| HTTP Code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 400 |Default HTTP code. Used in most cases and is typically due to a malformed request. Fix and resubmit the request. |
| 401 |Authentication failed. For example, the request is missing the client_secret parameter. |
| 403 |Authorization failed. For example, the user does not have permission to access the resource. |
| 500 |An internal error has occurred at the service. Retry the request. |

#### Error codes for token endpoint errors
| Error Code | Description | Client Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| invalid_request |Protocol error, such as a missing required parameter. |Fix and resubmit the request |
| invalid_grant |The authorization code is invalid or has expired. |Try a new request to the `/authorize` endpoint |
| unauthorized_client |The authenticated client is not authorized to use this authorization grant type. |This usually occurs when the client application is not registered in Azure AD or is not added to the user's Azure AD tenant. The application can prompt the user with instruction for installing the application and adding it to Azure AD. |
| invalid_client |Client authentication failed. |The client credentials are not valid. To fix, the application administrator updates the credentials. |
| unsupported_grant_type |The authorization server does not support the authorization grant type. |Change the grant type in the request. This type of error should occur only during development and be detected during initial testing. |
| invalid_resource |The target resource is invalid because it does not exist, Azure AD cannot find it, or it is not correctly configured. |This indicates the resource, if it exists, has not been configured in the tenant. The application can prompt the user with instruction for installing the application and adding it to Azure AD. |
| interaction_required |The request requires user interaction. For example, an additional authentication step is required. |Retry the request with the same resource. |
| temporarily_unavailable |The server is temporarily too busy to handle the request. |Retry the request. The client application might explain to the user that its response is delayed due a temporary condition. |

## Use the access token to access the resource
Now that you've successfully acquired an `access_token`, you can use the token in requests to Web APIs, by including it in the `Authorization` header. The [RFC 6750](http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6750.txt) specification explains how to use bearer tokens in HTTP requests to access protected resources.

### Sample request
```

### Error Response
Secured resources that implement RFC 6750 issue HTTP status codes. If the request does not include authentication credentials or is missing the token, the response includes an `WWW-Authenticate` header. When a request fails, the resource server responds with the an HTTP status code and an error code.

The following is an example of an unsuccessful response when the client request does not include the bearer token:

```
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
WWW-Authenticate: Bearer authorization_uri="https://login.window.net/contoso.com/oauth2/authorize",  error="invalid_token",  error_description="The access token is missing.",
```

#### Error parameters
| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| authorization_uri |The URI (physical endpoint) of the authorization server. This value is also used as a lookup key to get more information about the server from a discovery endpoint. <p><p> The client must validate that the authorization server is trusted. When the resource is protected by Azure AD, it is sufficient to verify that the URL begins with https://login.windows.net or another hostname that Azure AD supports. A tenant-specific resource should always return a tenant-specific authorization URI. |
| error |An error code value defined in Section 5.2 of the [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749). |
| error_description |A more detailed description of the error. This message is not intended to be end-user friendly. |
| resource_id |Returns the unique identifier of the resource. The client application can use this identifier as the value of the `resource` parameter when it requests a token for the resource. <p><p> It is very important for the client application to verify this value, otherwise a malicious service might be able to induce an **elevation-of-privileges** attack <p><p> The recommended strategy for preventing an attack is to verify that the `resource_id` matches the base of the web API URL that being accessed. For example, if https://service.contoso.com/data is being accessed, the `resource_id` can be htttps://service.contoso.com/. The client application must reject a `resource_id` that does not begin with the base URL unless there is a reliable alternate way to verify the id. |

#### Bearer scheme error codes
The RFC 6750 specification defines the following errors for resources that use using the WWW-Authenticate header and Bearer scheme in the response.

| HTTP Status Code | Error Code | Description | Client Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 400 |invalid_request |The request is not well-formed. For example, it might be missing a parameter or using the same parameter twice. |Fix the error and retry the request. This type of error should occur only during development and be detected in initial testing. |
| 401 |invalid_token |The access token is missing, invalid, or is revoked. The value of the error_description parameter provides additional detail. |Request a new token from the authorization server. If the new token fails, an unexpected error has occurred. Send an error message to the user and retry after random delays. |
| 403 |insufficient_scope |The access token does not contain the impersonation permissions required to access the resource. |Send a new authorization request to the authorization endpoint. If the response contains the scope parameter, use the scope value in the request to the resource. |
| 403 |insufficient_access |The subject of the token does not have the permissions that are required to access the resource. |Prompt the user to use a different account or to request permissions to the specified resource. |

## Refreshing the access tokens
Access Tokens are short-lived and must be refreshed after they expire to continue accessing resources. You can refresh the `access_token` by submitting another `POST` request to the `/token` endpoint, but this time providing the `refresh_token` instead of the `code`.

Refresh tokens do not have specified lifetimes. Typically, the lifetimes of refresh tokens are relatively long. However, in some cases, refresh tokens expire, are revoked, or lack sufficient privileges for the desired action. Your application needs to expect and handle errors returned by the token issuance endpoint correctly.

When you receive a response with a refresh token error, discard the current refresh token and request a new authorization code or access token. In particular, when using a refresh token in the Authorization Code Grant flow, if you receive a response with the `interaction_required` or `invalid_grant` error codes, discard the refresh token and request a new authorization code.

A sample request to the **tenant-specific** endpoint (you can also use the **common** endpoint) to get a new access token using a refresh token looks like this:

```
// Line breaks for legibility only

POST /{tenant}/oauth2/token HTTP/1.1
Host: https://login.microsoftonline.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

client_id=6731de76-14a6-49ae-97bc-6eba6914391e
&refresh_token=OAAABAAAAiL9Kn2Z27UubvWFPbm0gLWQJVzCTE9UkP3pSx1aXxUjq...
&grant_type=refresh_token
&resource=https%3A%2F%2Fservice.contoso.com%2F
&client_secret=JqQX2PNo9bpM0uEihUPzyrh    // NOTE: Only required for web apps
```
| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| access_token |The new access token that was requested. |
| expires_in |The remaining lifetime of the token in seconds. A typical value is 3600 (one hour). |
| expires_on |The date and time on which the token expires. The date is represented as the number of seconds from 1970-01-01T0:0:0Z UTC until the expiration time. |
| refresh_token |A new OAuth 2.0 refresh_token that can be used to request new access tokens when the one in this response expires. |
| resource |Identifies the secured resource that the access token can be used to access. |
| scope |Impersonation permissions granted to the native client application. The default permission is **user_impersonation**. The owner of the target resource can register alternate values in Azure AD. |
| token_type |The token type. The only supported value is **bearer**. |

### Successful response
