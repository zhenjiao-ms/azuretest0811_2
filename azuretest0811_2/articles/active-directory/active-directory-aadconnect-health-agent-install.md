## Installing the Azure AD Connect Health agent for sync
The Azure AD Connect Health agent for sync is installed automatically in the latest build of Azure AD Connect.  To use Azure AD Connect for sync you will need to download the latest version of Azure AD Connect and install it.  You can download the latest version [here](http://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=47594).

To verify the agent has been installed, open services and look for the following. These services should be running if you completed the configuration. Otherwise, they will not start until the configuration is complete.

* Azure AD Connect Health Sync Insights Service
* Azure AD Connect Health Sync Monitoring Service

![Verify Azure AD Connect Health for Sync](./media/active-directory-aadconnect-health-sync/services.png)

> [!NOTE]
> Remember that using Azure AD Connect Health requires Azure AD Premium.  If you do not have Azure AD Premium you will not be able to complete the configuration in the Azure portal.  For more information see the requirements [here](active-directory-aadconnect-health-agent-install.md#requirements).
> 
> 

## Manual Azure AD Connect Health for Sync registration
If the Azure AD Connect Health for Sync agent registration fails after successfully installing Azure AD Connect, you can use the following PowerShell command to manually register the agent.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Using this PowerShell command is only required if the agent registration fails after installing Azure AD Connect.
> 
> 

The below PowerShell command is required ONLY when the health agent registration fails even after a successful installation and configuration of Azure AD Connect. In such cases Azure AD Connect Health services will NOT start until agent has been successfully registered.

You can manually register the Azure AD Connect Health agent for sync using the following PowerShell command:

`Register-AzureADConnectHealthSyncAgent -AttributeFiltering $false -StagingMode $false`

The command takes following parameters:

* AttributeFiltering : $true (default) - if Azure AD Connect is not syncing the default attribute set and has been customized to use a filtered attribute set. $false otherwise.
* StagingMode : $false (default) - if the Azure AD Connect server is NOT in staging mode, $true if the server is configured to be in staging mode.

When prompted for authentication you should use the same global admin account (such as admin@domain.onmicrosoft.com) that was used for configuring Azure AD Connect.

## Installing the  Azure AD Connect Health Agent for AD DS
To start the agent installation, double-click on the .exe file that you downloaded. On the first screen, click Install.

![Verify Azure AD Connect Health](./media/active-directory-aadconnect-health/aadconnect-health-adds-agent-install1.png)

Once the installation is finished, click Configure Now.

![Verify Azure AD Connect Health](./media/active-directory-aadconnect-health/aadconnect-health-adds-agent-install2.png)

This will launch a command prompt followed by some PowerShell that will execute Register-AzureADConnectHealthADDSAgent. You will be prompted to sign in to Azure. Go ahead and sign in.

![Verify Azure AD Connect Health](./media/active-directory-aadconnect-health/aadconnect-health-adds-agent-install3.png)

After signing in, PowerShell will continue. Once it completes you can close PowerShell and the configuration is complete.

At this point, the services should be started automatically and the agent will be now monitoring and gathering data. The screenshot below is an example of the output. Be aware that you will see warnings in the PowerShell window if you have not met all of the pre-requisites that were outlined in the previous sections. Be sure to complete the requirements [here](active-directory-aadconnect-health-agent-install.md#requirements) prior to installing the agent. 

![Verify Azure AD Connect Health for AD DS](./media/active-directory-aadconnect-health/aadconnect-health-adds-agent-install4.png)

To verify the agent has been installed, open services and look for the following:

* Azure AD Connect Health AD DS Insights Service
* Azure AD Connect Health AD DS Monitoring Service

These two services will not start until the configuration is complete.

![Verify Azure AD Connect Health](./media/active-directory-aadconnect-health/aadconnect-health-adds-agent-install5.png)

## Installing the Azure AD Connect Health Agent for AD DS on Server Core.
After installing the .exe file, you can complete the registration process by using the following PowerShell command:

`Register-AzureADConnectHealthADDSAgent -Credentials $cred

## Configure Azure AD Connect Health Agents to use HTTP Proxy
You can configure Azure AD Connect Health Agents to work with an HTTP Proxy.

> [!NOTE]
> * Using “Netsh WinHttp set ProxyServerAddress” will not work as the agent uses System.Net to make web requests instead of Microsoft Windows HTTP Services.
> * The configured Http Proxy address will be used to pass-through encrypted Https messages.
> * Authenticated proxies (using HTTPBasic) are not supported.
> 
> 

### Change Health Agent Proxy Configuration
You have the following options to configure Azure AD Connect Health Agent to use an HTTP Proxy.

> [!NOTE]
> You must restart all Azure AD Connect Health Agent services for the proxy settings to be updated. Run the following command:<br>
> Restart-Service AdHealth*
> 
> 

#### Import existing proxy Settings
##### Import from Internet Explorer
You can import your Internet Explorer HTTP proxy settings and use them for Azure AD Connect Health Agents by executing the following PowerShell command on each server running the Health Agent.

    Set-AzureAdConnectHealthProxySettings -ImportFromInternetSettings

##### Import from WinHTTP
You can import you WinHTTP proxy settings by executing the following PowerShell command on each server running the Health Agent.

    Set-AzureAdConnectHealthProxySettings -ImportFromWinHttp

#### Specify Proxy addresses manually
You can specify a proxy server manually by executing the following PowerShell command on each server running the Health Agent.

    Set-AzureAdConnectHealthProxySettings -HttpsProxyAddress address:port

Example: *Set-AzureAdConnectHealthProxySettings -HttpsProxyAddress myproxyserver:443*

* "address" can be a DNS resolvable server name or an IPv4 address
* "port" can be omitted. If omitted then 443 is chosen as default port.

#### Clear existing proxy configuration
You can clear the existing proxy configuration by running the following command.

    Set-AzureAdConnectHealthProxySettings -NoProxy


### Read current proxy settings
You can use the following command to read the currently configured proxy settings.

    Get-AzureAdConnectHealthProxySettings


## Test Connectivity to Azure AD Connect Health Service
It is possible that issues may arise that cause the Azure AD Connect Health agent to lose connectivity with the Azure AD Connect Health service.  These include network issues, permission issues, or various other reasons.

If the agent is unable to send data to the Azure AD Connect Health service for more than 2 hours, you will see an Alert indicating "Health Service data is not up to date."  Should this occur you can now test whether or not the Azure AD Connect Health agents are able to upload data to the Azure AD Connect Health service by running the following PowerShell command from the machine whose agent is having the issue.

    Test-AzureADConnectHealthConnectivity -Role Adfs

The role parameter currently takes the following values:

* Adfs
* Sync
* ADDS

You can use the -ShowResults flag in the command to view detailed logs.  Use the following example:

    Test-AzureADConnectHealthConnectivity -Role Sync -ShowResult

> [!NOTE]
> In order to use the connectivity tool, you must first complete the agent registration.  If you are not able to complete the agent registration, make sure that you have met all of the [requirements](active-directory-aadconnect-health-agent-install.md#requirements) for Azure AD Connect Health.  This connectivity test is performed by default during agent registration.
