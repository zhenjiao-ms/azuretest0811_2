# Azure AD Connect sync: Attributes synchronized to Azure Active Directory
This topic lists the attributes that are synchronized by Azure AD Connect sync.  
The attributes are grouped by the related Azure AD app.

## Attributes to synchronize
A common question is *what is the list of minimum attributes to synchronize*. The default and recommended approach is to keep the default attributes so a full GAL (Global Address List) can be constructed in the cloud and to get all features in Office 365 workloads. In some cases there are some attributes which your organization do not want synchronized to the cloud since they contain sensitive or PII (Personally identifiable information) data, like in the example below.

![bad attributes](./media/active-directory-aadconnectsync-attributes-synchronized/badextensionattribute.png)

In this case, start with the list of attributes below and identify those which would contain sensitive or PII data and cannot be synchronized. Then deselect those during installation using [Azure AD app and attribute filtering](active-directory-aadconnect-get-started-custom.md#azure-ad-app-and-attribute-filtering).

> [!WARNING]
> When deselecting attributes, you should be cautious and only deselect those absolutely not possible to synchronize. Unselecting other attributes might have a negative impact on features.

## 3rd party applications
This is a set of attributes used as the minimal attributes needed for a generic workload or application. It can be used for workload not listed above or for a non-Microsoft app. It is explicitly used for the following:

* Yammer (only User is actually consumed)
* [Hybrid Business-to-Business (B2B) cross-org collaboration scenarios offered by resources like SharePoint](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=747036)

This is a set of attributes which can be used if the Azure AD directory is not used to support Office 365, Dynamics, or Intune. It has a small set of core attributes.

## Windows 10
Windows 10 domain-joined computers(devices) will synchronize some attributes to Azure AD. For more information on the scenarios see [Connect domain-joined devices to Azure AD for Windows 10 experiences](active-directory-azureadjoin-devices-group-policy.md). These attributes will always synchronize and Windows 10 does not appear as an app you can unselect. A Windows 10 domain-joined computer is identified by having the attribute userCertificate populated.

| Attribute Name | Device | Comment |
| --- |:---:| --- |
| accountEnabled |X | |
| deviceTrustType |X |Hardcoded value for domain-joined computers. |
| displayName |X | |
| ms-DS-CreatorSID |X |Also called registeredOwnerReference. |
| objectGUID |X |Also called deviceID. |
| objectSID |X |Also called onPremisesSecurityIdentifier. |
| operatingSystem |X |Also called deviceOSType. |
| operatingSystemVersion |X |Also called deviceOSVersion. |
| userCertificate |X | |

These attributes for user is in addition to the other apps you have selected.  

| Attribute Name | User | Comment |
| --- |:---:| --- |
| domainFQDN |X |Also called dnsDomainName. E.g. contoso.com. |
| domainNetBios |X |Also called netBiosName. E.g. CONTOSO. |

## Exchange hybrid writeback
These attributes are written back from Azure AD to on-premises Active Directory when you select to enable Exchange hybrid. Depending on your Exchange version, fewer attributes might be synchronized.

| Attribute Name | User | Contact | Group | Comment |
| --- |:---:|:---:|:---:| --- |
| msDS-ExternalDirectoryObjectID |X | | |Derived from cloudAnchor in Azure AD. This is new in Exchange 2016. |

| msExchUserHoldPolicies |X | | |Litigation Hold: Enables cloud services to determine which users are under Litigation Hold. |
| proxyAddresses |X |X |X |Only the x500 address from Exchange Online is inserted. |

## Device writeback
Device objects are created in Active Directory. These can be devices joined to Azure AD or domain-joined Windows 10 computers.

| Attribute Name | Device | Comment |

## Notes
* When using an Alternate ID, the on-premises attribute userPrincipalName will be synchronized with the Azure AD attribute onPremisesUserPrincipalName. The Alternate ID attribute, e.g. mail, will be synchronized with the Azure AD attribute userPrincipalName.
* In the lists above, the object type **User** also applies to the object type **iNetOrgPerson**.
