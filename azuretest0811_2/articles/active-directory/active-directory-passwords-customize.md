## Password management look and feel
The following table describes how each control affects the experience for users registering for password reset and resetting their passwords.

## Password Management behavior
The following table describes how each control affects the experience for users registering for password reset and resetting their passwords.  You can configure these options under the **User Password Reset Policy** section of your directory’s **Configure** tab in the [Azure Management Portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com).

> [!NOTE]
> The administrator account you are using must have an AAD Premium license assigned in order to see these policy controls.<br><br>These policy controls only apply to end users resetting their passwords, not administrators.  **Administrators have a default policy of alternate email and/or mobile phone that is specified for them by Microsoft which cannot be changed.**
