# Azure Active Directory editions
All Microsoft Online business services rely on Azure Active Directory for sign-on and other identity needs. If you subscribe to any of Microsoft Online business services (e.g. Office 365, Microsoft Azure, etc), you get Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) with access to all of the Free features, described below.  

Azure Active Directory is a service that provides comprehensive identity and access management capabilities in the cloud for your employees, partners and customers. It combines directory services, advanced identity governance, a rich standards-based platform for developers, and application access management for your own or any of thousands of pre-integrated applications. With the Azure Active Directory Free edition, you can manage users and groups, synchronize with on-premises directories, get single sign-on across Azure, Office 365, and thousands of popular SaaS applications like Salesforce, Workday, Concur, DocuSign, Google Apps, Box, ServiceNow, Dropbox, and more. To learn more about Azure Active Directory, read [What is Azure AD](active-directory-whatis.md).

To enhance your Azure Active Directory, you can add paid capabilities using the Azure Active Directory Basic and Premium editions. Azure Active Directory paid editions are built on top of your existing free directory, providing enterprise class capabilities spanning self-service, enhanced monitoring, security reporting, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), and secure access for your mobile workforce.

Office 365 subscriptions include additional Azure Active Directory features described in the comparison table below. 

> [!NOTE]
> For the pricing options of these editions, see [Azure Active Directory Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/active-directory/). Azure Active Directory Premium and Azure Active Directory Basic are not currently supported in China. Please contact us at the Azure Active Directory Forum for more information
