# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with HR2day by Merces
The objective of this tutorial is to show you how to integrate HR2day by Merces with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).  
Integrating HR2day by Merces with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

* You can control in Azure AD who has access to HR2day by Merces
* You can enable your users to automatically get signed-on to HR2day by Merces (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts
* You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure classic portal

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis.md).

## Prerequisites
To configure Azure AD integration with HR2day by Merces, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription
* A HR2day by Merces single-sign on enabled subscription

> [!NOTE]
> To test the steps in this tutorial, we do not recommend using a production environment.
> 
> 

To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

* You should not use your production environment, unless this is necessary.
* If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can get a one-month trial [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

## Scenario Description
The objective of this tutorial is to enable you to test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.  
The scenario outlined in this tutorial consists of two main building blocks:

1. Adding HR2day by Merces from the gallery
2. Configuring and testing Azure AD single sign-on

## Adding HR2day by Merces from the gallery
To configure the integration of HR2day by Merces into Azure AD, you need to add HR2day by Merces from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add HR2day by Merces from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **Azure classic portal**, on the left navigation pane, click **Active Directory**. 
   
    ![Active Directory](./media/active-directory-saas-hr2day-tutorial/tutorial_general_01.png)
2. From the **Directory** list, select the directory for which you want to enable directory integration.
3. To open the applications view, in the directory view, click **Applications** in the top menu.
   
    ![Applications](./media/active-directory-saas-hr2day-tutorial/tutorial_general_02.png)
4. Click **Add** at the bottom of the page.
   
    ![Applications](./media/active-directory-saas-hr2day-tutorial/tutorial_general_03.png)
5. On the **What do you want to do** dialog, click **Add an application from the gallery**.
   
    ![Applications](./media/active-directory-saas-hr2day-tutorial/tutorial_general_04.png)
6. In the search box, type **HR2day by Merces**.
   
    ![Creating an Azure AD test user](./media/active-directory-saas-hr2day-tutorial/tutorial_hr2day_01.png)
7. In the results pane, select **HR2day by Merces**, and then click **Complete** to add the application.

## Configuring and testing Azure AD single sign-on
The objective of this section is to show you how to configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with HR2day by Merces based on a test user called "Britta Simon".

For single sign-on to work, Azure AD needs to know what the counterpart user in HR2day by Merces to an user in Azure AD is. In other words, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in HR2day by Merces needs to be established.  
This link relationship is established by assigning the value of the **user name** in Azure AD as the value of the **Username** in HR2day by Merces.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with HR2day by Merces, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configuring Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configuring-azure-ad-single-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Creating an Azure AD test user](#creating-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
3. **[Creating a HR2day by Merces test user](#creating-a-hr2day-by-merces-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in HR2day by Merces that is linked to the Azure AD representation of her.
4. **[Assigning the Azure AD test user](#assigning-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Testing Single Sign-On](#testing-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configuring Azure AD Single Sign-On
The objective of this section is to outline how to enable users to authenticate to HR2day by Merces with their account in Azure AD using federation based on the SAML protocol.

Your HR2day by Merces application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows an example for this. 

![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/active-directory-saas-hr2day-tutorial/tutorial_hr2day_00.png) 

Before you can configure the SAML assertion, you need to contact your HR2day support team via [servicedesk@merces.nl](mailto:servicedesk@merces.nl) and request the value of the unique identifier attribute for your tenant. You need this value to complete the steps in the next section.

**To configure Azure AD single sign-on with HR2day by Merces, perform the following steps:**

1. In the Azure classic portal, on the **HR2day by Merces** application integration page, in the menu on the top, click **Attributes** to open the **SAML Token Attributes** dialog. 
   
    ![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/active-directory-saas-hr2day-tutorial/tutorial_hr2day_06.png)

    ![Configure Single Sign-On](./media/active-directory-saas-hr2day-tutorial/tutorial_hr2day_07.png) 

    a. Click **add user attribute**.

    b. In the **Attribute Name** textbox, type **“ATTR_LOGINCLAIM”**.

    c. From the **Attribute Value** list, select **Join()**. 

    d. From the **String1** list, select **User.mail**.
