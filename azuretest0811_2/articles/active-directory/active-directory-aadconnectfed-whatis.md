# Azure AD Connect and federation
Azure AD Connect lets you configure federation with the on-premises AD FS and Azure AD. With federation sign on, you can enable users to sign on to Azure AD based services with their on-premises passwords and, while on the corporate network, without having to enter their passwords again. The federation option with AD FS allows you to deploy a new or specify an existing AD FS in Windows Server 2012 R2 farm.

This topic is the home for information on Federation related functionalities for Azure AD Connect and lists links to all other topics related to it. For links to Azure AD Connect, see Integrating your on-premises identities with Azure Active Directory.
