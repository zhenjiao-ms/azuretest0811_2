# Azure Active Directory Identity Protection notifications
Azure AD Identity Protection sends two types of automated notification emails to help you manage user risk and risk events:

* User compromised alert email
* Weekly digest email

## User compromised alert email
A user compromised email alert is generated when Azure AD Identity Protection identifies an account as compromised. The email includes a link to the Users flagged for risk report in the Identity Protection dashboard. We recommend that you immediately investigate notifications of compromised.

## Weekly digest email
The weekly digest email contains a summary of new risk events.<br>
It includes:

* Users at risk
* Suspicious activities
* Detected vulnerabilities
* Links to the related reports in Identity Protection

<br>

You can switch sending a weekly digest email off.
