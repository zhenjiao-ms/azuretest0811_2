# Hybrid Identity Required Ports and Protocols
The following document is a technical reference to provide information on the required ports and protocols that are required for implementing a hybrid identity solution.  Use the illustration below and refer to the corresponding table.

![What is Azure AD Connect](./media/active-directory-aadconnect-ports/required1.png)

## Table 1 - Azure AD Connect and On-premises AD
This table describes the ports and protocols that are required for communication between the Azure AD Connect server and on-premises AD.

| Protocol | Ports | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DNS |53 (TCP/UDP) |DNS lookups on the destination forest. |
| Kerberos |88 (TCP/UDP) |Kerberos authentication to the AD forest. |
| MS-RPC |135 (TCP/UDP) |Used during the initial configuration of the Azure AD Connect wizard when it binds to the AD forest. |
| LDAP |389 (TCP/UDP) |Used for data import from AD.  Data is encrypted with Kerberos Sign & Seal. |
| LDAP/SSL |636 (TCP/UDP) |Used for data import from AD.  The data transfer is signed and encrypted.  Only used if you are using SSL. |
| RPC |1024-65353 (Random high RPC Port)(TCP/UDP) |Used during the initial configuration of Azure AD Connect when it binds to the AD forests. |

## Table 2 - Azure AD Connect and Azure AD
This table describes the ports and protocols that are required for communication between the Azure AD Connect server and Azure AD.

| Protocol | Ports | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| HTTP |80 (TCP/UDP) |Used to download CRLs (Certificate Revocation Lists) to verify SSL certificates. |
| HTTPS |443(TCP/UDP) |Used to synchronize with Azure AD. |

## Table 3 - Azure AD Connect and Federation Servers/WAP
This table describes the ports and protocols that are required for communication between the Azure AD Connect server and Federation/WAP servers.  

| Protocol | Ports | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| HTTP |80 (TCP/UDP) |Used to download CRLs (Certificate Revocation Lists) to verify SSL certificates. |
| HTTPS |443(TCP/UDP) |Used to synchronize with Azure AD. |
| WinRM |5985 |WinRM Listener |

## Table 4 - WAP and Federation Servers
This table describes the ports and protocols that are required for communication between the Federation servers and WAP servers.

| Protocol | Ports | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| HTTPS |443(TCP/UDP) |Used for authentication. |

## Table 5 - WAP and Users
This table describes the ports and protocols that are required for communication between users and the WAP servers.

| Protocol | Ports | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| HTTPS |443(TCP/UDP) |Used for device authentication. |
| TCP |49443 (TCP) |Used for certificate authentication. |

## Table 6a & 6b - Azure AD Connect Health agent for (AD FS/Sync) and Azure AD

### Table 6a - Ports and Protocols for Azure AD Connect Health agent for (AD FS/Sync) and Azure AD
This table describes the following outbound ports and protocols that are required for communication between the Azure AD Connect Health agents and Azure AD.  

| Protocol | Ports | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| HTTPS |443(TCP/UDP) |Outbound |
| Azure Service Bus |5671 (TCP/UDP) |Outbound |

### 6b - Endpoints for Azure AD Connect Health agent for (AD FS/Sync) and Azure AD
