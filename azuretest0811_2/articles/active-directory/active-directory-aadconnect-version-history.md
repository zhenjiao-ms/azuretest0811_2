## 1.1.119.0
Released: 2016 March

* If you install and unselect **Start the synchronization process..** at the end of the installation wizard, re-running the installation wizard will not enable the scheduler.

## 1.0.9125.0
Released: 2015 November

**New features:**

**Fixed issues:**

  * Selecting a new OU to include in sync does not require a full password sync.
  * When a disabled user is enabled the password does not sync.
  * The password retry queue is infinite and the previous limit of 5,000 objects to be retired has been removed.
  * [Improved troubleshooting](active-directory-aadconnectsync-implement-password-synchronization.md#troubleshoot-password-synchronization).

* Cannot install Azure AD Connect using Express install if the user is not in the root domain of the forest or if a non-English version of Active Directory is used.
* If the FQDN of the Active Directory user account cannot be resolved, a misleading error message “Failed to commit the schema” is shown.

* The Active Directory Connector does not process deletes correctly if the recycle bin is enabled and there are multiple domains in the forest.
* The performance of import operations has been improved for the Azure Active Directory Connector.
* When a group has exceeded the membership limit (by default, the limit is set to 50k objects), the group was deleted in Azure Active Directory. The new behavior is that the group will remain, an error is thrown and no new membership changes will be exported.

* Joining Foreign Security Principals (FSPs) from multiple domains in same forest causes an ambiguous-join error.

## 1.0.475.1202
Released: 2014 December

**New features:**

* It is now supported to do password synchronization with attribute based filtering. For more details, see [Password synchronization with filtering](active-directory-aadconnectsync-configure-filtering.md).
* The attribute msDS-ExternalDirectoryObjectID is written back to AD. This adds support for Office 365 applications using OAuth2 to access both, Online and On-Premises mailboxes in a Hybrid Exchange Deployment.

**Fixed upgrade issues:**

## 1.0.470.1023
Released: 2014 October

**New features:**

* Password synchronization from multiple on-premise AD to Azure AD.
* Localized installation UI to all Windows Server languages.

**Upgrading from AADSync 1.0 GA**

If you already have Azure AD Sync installed, there is one additional step you have to take in case you have changed any of the out-of-box Synchronization Rules. After you have upgraded to the 1.0.470.1023 release, the synchronization rules you have modified are duplicated. For each modified Sync Rule do the following:

* Locate the Sync Rule you have modified and take a note of the changes.
* Delete the Sync Rule.
* Locate the new Sync Rule created by Azure AD Sync and re-apply the changes.

**Permissions for the AD account**

The AD account must be granted additional permissions to be able to read the password hashes from AD. The permissions to grant are named “Replicating Directory Changes” and “Replicating Directory Changes All”. Both permissions are required to be able to read the password hashes

## 1.0.419.0911
Released: 2014 September

**Initial release of Azure AD Sync.**
