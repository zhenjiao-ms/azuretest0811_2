# Azure AD Connect sync: Directory extensions
Directory extensions allows you to extend the schema in Azure AD with your own attributes from on-premises Active Directory. This allows you to build LOB apps consuming attributes you continue to manage on-premises. These attributes can be consumed through [Azure AD Graph directory extensions](https://msdn.microsoft.com/Library/Azure/Ad/Graph/howto/azure-ad-graph-api-directory-schema-extensions) or [Microsoft Graph](https://graph.microsoft.io/). You can see the attributes available using [Azure AD Graph explorer](https://graphexplorer.cloudapp.net) and [Microsoft Graph explorer](https://graphexplorer2.azurewebsites.net/) respectively.

At present no Office 365 workload will consume these attributes.

You configure which additional attributes you want to synchronize in the custom settings path in the installation wizard.

The installation will show the following attributes, which are valid candidates:

* User and Group object types
* Single-valued attributes: String, Boolean, Integer, Binary
* Multi-valued attributes: String, Binary

An object can have up to 100 directory extensions attributes. The max length is 250 characters. If an attribute value is longer, it will be truncated by the sync engine.

During installation of Azure AD Connect, an application will be registered where these attributes will be available. You can see this application in the Azure portal.

These attributes will now be available through Graph:

The attributes are prefixed with extension\_{AppClientId}\_. The AppClientId will have the same value for all attributes in your Azure AD directory.
