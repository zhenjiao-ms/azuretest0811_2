## Single Sign-On (SSO)
### Federated Single Sign-On: Sign into many apps using one identity
Single sign-on allows users to access a variety of apps and services using only one set of credentials. Federation is one method through which you can enable single sign-on. When users attempt to sign into federated apps, they will get redirected to their organization's official sign-in page rendered by Azure Active Directory, and are then redirected back to the app upon successful authentication.

Federated single sign-on is available for all editions of Azure AD for up to ten apps per user. [Azure AD Premium](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/active-directory/) supports unlimited applications. If your organization has [Azure AD Basic](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/active-directory/) or [Azure AD Premium](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/active-directory/), then you can [use groups to assign access to federated applications](#managing-access-to-applications).

### Password-Based Single Sign-On: Account sharing and SSO for non-federated apps
To enable single sign-on to applications that don't support federation, Azure AD offers password management features that can securely store passwords to SaaS apps and automatically sign users into those apps. You can easily distribute credentials for newly created accounts and share team accounts with multiple people. Users don't necessarily need to know the credentials to the accounts that they're given access to.

Automated password rollover is an [Azure AD Premium](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/active-directory/) feature.

### App Proxy: Single sign-on and remote access to on-premises applications
If you have applications in your private network that need to be accessed by users and devices outside the network, then you can use Azure AD Application Proxy to enable secure, remote access to those apps.

### Enabling single sign-on between Azure AD and on-premises AD
If your organization maintains a Windows Server Active Directory on premises along with your Azure Active Directory in the cloud, then you will likely want to enable single sign-on between these two systems. Azure AD Connect (the tool that integrates these two systems together) provides multiple options for setting up single sign-on: establish federation with ADFS or another federation provider, or enable password synchronization.

Azure AD Self-Service Password Reset is available for [Azure AD Basic](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/active-directory/) and [Azure AD Premium](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/active-directory/). Password Writeback to on-prem AD is an [Azure AD Premium](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/active-directory/) feature. 

### Conditional Access: Enforce additional security requirements for high-risk apps
Once you set up single sign-on to your apps and resources, you can then further secure sensitive applications by enforcing specific security requirements on every sign-in to that app. For instance, you can use Azure AD to demand that all access to a particular app always require multi-factor authentication, regardless of whether or not that app innately supports that functionality. Another common example of conditional access is to require that users be connected to the organization's trusted network in order to access a particularly sensitive application.
