# Azure AD and Applications: Assigning Groups to an Application
Before you can assign users and groups to an application, you must require user assignment. To learn how to require user assignment, see the [Requiring User Assignment](active-directory-applications-guiding-developers-requiring-user-assignment.md) article.

This article assumes that you have already created groups in the active directory you are using for this application.

## Assigning Groups to an Application
1. Log in to the Azure portal with an administrator account.
2. Click on the **All Items** item in the main menu.
3. Choose the directory you are using for the application.
4. Click on the **APPLICATIONS** tab.
5. Select the application from the list of applications associated with this directory.
6. Click the **USERS AND GROUPS** tab.
7. Filter the list of groups in your active directory by using the **Groups** dropdown list.
8. Select the group.
9. Click **ASSIGN**.
10. Click **yes** when prompted.
