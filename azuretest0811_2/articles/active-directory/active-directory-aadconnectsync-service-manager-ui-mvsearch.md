The metaverse search tab is useful for troubleshooting data related problems. In the top half you can create a query based on a combination of attributes. When you are satisfied with your query, click on **Search**. The result will be visible in the bottom grid. You can select which columns should be visible with **Column Settings**.

In the search results, select an object and **Properties** to see the [metaverse object properties](active-directory-aadconnectsync-service-manager-ui-connectors.md#metaverse-object-properties).
