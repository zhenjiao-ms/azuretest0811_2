## 1.1.117.0
Released: 2016 March

**New Connector**  
Initial release of the [Generic SQL Connector](active-directory-aadconnectsync-connector-genericsql.md).

**New features:**

* Generic LDAP Connector:
  * Added support for delta import with Isode.
* Web Services Connector:
  * Updated the csEntryChangeResult activity and setImportErrorCode activity to allow object level errors to be returned back to the sync engine.
  * Updated the SAP6 and SAP6User templates to use the new object level error functionality.
* Lotus Domino Connector:
  * When exporting you need one certifier per address book. You can now use the same password for all certifiers to make the management easier.

**Fixed issues:**

* Generic LDAP Connector:
  * For IBM Tivoli DS, some reference attributes were not detected correctly.
  * For Open LDAP during a delta import, whitespaces at the beginning and end of strings were truncated.
  * For Novell and NetIQ, an export which both moved an object between OUs/containers and at the same time renamed the object failed.
* Web Services Connector:
  * If the web service had multiple end-points for same binding, then the Connector did not correctly discover these end-points.
* Lotus Domino Connector:
  * An export of the fullName attribute to a mail-in database did not work.
  * An export which both added and removed member from a group only exported the added members.
  * If a Notes Document is invalid (the attribute isValid set to false) then the Connector fails.
