# v2.0 Protocols - SPAs using the implicit flow
With the v2.0 endpoint, you can sign users into your single page apps with both personal and work/school accounts from Microsoft.  Single page and other JavaScript apps that run primarily in a browser face a few interesting challenges when it comes to authentication:

* The security characteristics of these apps are significantly different from traditional server based web applications.
* Many authorization servers & identity providers do not support CORS requests.
* Full page browser redirects away from the app become particularly invasive to the user experience.

For these applications (think: AngularJS, Ember.js, React.js, etc) Azure AD supports the OAuth 2.0 Implicit Grant flow.  The implicit flow is described in the [OAuth 2.0 Specification](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.2).  Its primary benefit is that it allows the app to get tokens from Azure AD without performing a backend server credential exchange.  This allows the app to sign in the user, maintain session, and get tokens to other web APIs all within the client JavaScript code.  There are a few important security considerations to take into account when using the implicit flow - specifically around [client](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-10.3) and [user impersonation](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-10.3).

If you want to use the implicit flow and Azure AD to add authentication to your JavaScript app, we recommend you use our open source JavaScript library, [adal.js](https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-library-for-js).  There are few AngularJS tutorials available [here](active-directory-appmodel-v2-overview.md#getting-started) to help you get started.  

However, if you would prefer not to use a library in your single page app and send protocol messages yourself, follow the general steps below.

> [!NOTE]
> Not all Azure Active Directory scenarios & features are supported by the v2.0 endpoint.  To determine if you should use the v2.0 endpoint, read about [v2.0 limitations](active-directory-v2-limitations.md).

## Protocol diagram
The entire implicit sign in flow looks something like this - each of the steps are described in detail below.

![OpenId Connect Swimlanes](../media/active-directory-v2-flows/convergence_scenarios_implicit.png)

## Send the sign-in request
To initially sign the user into your app, you can send an [OpenID Connect](active-directory-v2-protocols-oidc.md) authorization request and get an `id_token` from the v2.0 endpoint:

```
// Line breaks for legibility only

https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant}/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?
client_id=6731de76-14a6-49ae-97bc-6eba6914391e
&response_type=id_token+token
&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%2Fmyapp%2F
&scope=openid%20https%3A%2F%2Fgraph.microsoft.com%2Fmail.read
&response_mode=fragment
&state=12345
&nonce=678910
```

> [!TIP]
> Click the link below to execute this request! After signing in, your browser should be redirected to `https://localhost/myapp/` with a `id_token` in the address bar.

| Parameter |  | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| tenant |required |The `{tenant}` value in the path of the request can be used to control who can sign into the application.  The allowed values are `common`, `organizations`, `consumers`, and tenant identifiers.  For more detail, see [protocol basics](active-directory-v2-protocols.md#endpoints). |
| client_id |required |The Application Id that the registration portal ([apps.dev.microsoft.com](https://apps.dev.microsoft.com)) assigned your app. |
| response_type |required |Must include `id_token` for OpenID Connect sign-in.  It may also include the response_type `token`. Using `token` here will allow your app to receive an access token immediately from the authorize endpoint without having to make a second request to the authorize endpoint.  If you use the `token` response_type, the `scope` parameter must contain a scope indicating which resource to issue the token for. |
| redirect_uri |recommended |The redirect_uri of your app, where authentication responses can be sent and received by your app.  It must exactly match one of the redirect_uris you registered in the portal, except it must be url encoded. |
| scope |required |A space-separated list of scopes.  For OpenID Connect, it must include the scope `openid`, which translates to the "Sign you in" permission in the consent UI.  Optionally you may also want to include the `email` or `profile` [scopes](active-directory-v2-scopes.md) for gaining access to additional user data.  You may also include other scopes in this request for requesting consent to various resources. |
| response_mode |recommended |Specifies the method that should be used to send the resulting token back to your app.  Should be `fragment` for the implicit flow. |
| state |recommended |A value included in the request that will also be returned in the token response.  It can be a string of any content that you wish.  A randomly generated unique value is typically used for [preventing cross-site request forgery attacks](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-10.12).  The state is also used to encode information about the user's state in the app before the authentication request occurred, such as the page or view they were on. |
| nonce |required |A value included in the request, generated by the app, that will be included in the resulting id_token as a claim.  The app can then verify this value to mitigate token replay attacks.  The value is typically a randomized, unique string that can be used to identify the origin of the request. |
| prompt |optional |Indicates the type of user interaction that is required.  The only valid values at this time are 'login', 'none', and 'consent'.  `prompt=login` will force the user to enter their credentials on that request, negating single-sign on.  `prompt=none` is the opposite - it will ensure that the user is not presented with any interactive prompt whatsoever.  If the request cannot be completed silently via single-sign on, the v2.0 endpoint will return an error.  `prompt=consent` will trigger the OAuth consent dialog after the user signs in, asking the user to grant permissions to the app. |
| login_hint |optional |Can be used to pre-fill the username/email address field of the sign in page for the user, if you know their username ahead of time.  Often apps will use this parameter during re-authentication, having already extracted the username from a previous sign-in using the `preferred_username` claim. |
| domain_hint |optional |Can be one of `consumers` or `organizations`.  If included, it will skip the email-based discovery process that user goes through on the v2.0 sign in page, leading to a slightly more streamlined user experience.  Often apps will use this parameter during re-authentication, by extracting the `tid` claim from the id_token.  If the `tid` claim value is `9188040d-6c67-4c5b-b112-36a304b66dad`, you should use `domain_hint=consumers`.  Otherwise, use `domain_hint=organizations`. |

At this point, the user will be asked to enter their credentials and complete the authentication.  The v2.0 endpoint will also ensure that the user has consented to the permissions indicated in the `scope` query parameter.  If the user has not consented to any of those permissions, it will ask the user to consent to the required permissions.  Details of [permissions, consent, and multi-tenant apps are provided here](active-directory-v2-scopes.md).

Once the user authenticates and grants consent, the v2.0 endpoint will return a response to your app at the indicated `redirect_uri`, using the method specified in the `response_mode` parameter.

#### Successful response
A successful response using `response_mode=fragment` and `response_type=id_token+token` looks like the following, with line breaks for legibility:

```
GET https://localhost/myapp/#
access_token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsIng1dCI6Ik5HVEZ2ZEstZnl0aEV1Q...
&token_type=Bearer
&expires_in=3599
&scope=https%3a%2f%2fgraph.microsoft.com%2fmail.read 
&id_token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsIng1dCI6Ik5HVEZ2ZEstZnl0aEV1Q...
&state=12345
```

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| access_token |Included if `response_type` includes `token`. The access token that the app requested, in this case for the Microsoft Graph.  The access token should not be decoded or otherwise inspected, it can be treated as an opaque string. |
| token_type |Included if `response_type` includes `token`.  Will always be `Bearer`. |
| expires_in |Included if `response_type` includes `token`.  Indicates the number of seconds the token is valid, for caching purposes. |
| scope |Included if `response_type` includes `token`.  Indicates the scope(s) for which the access_token will be valid. |
| id_token |The id_token that the app requested. You can use the id_token to verify the user's identity and begin a session with the user.  More details on id_tokens and their contents is included in the [v2.0 endpoint token reference](active-directory-v2-tokens.md). |
| state |If a state parameter is included in the request, the same value should appear in the response. The  app should verify that the state values in the request and response are identical. |

#### Error response
Error responses may also be sent to the `redirect_uri` so the app can handle them appropriately:

```
GET https://localhost/myapp/#
error=access_denied
&error_description=the+user+canceled+the+authentication
```

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| error |An error code string that can be used to classify types of errors that occur, and can be used to react to errors. |
| error_description |A specific error message that can help a developer identify the root cause of an authentication error. |

## Validate the id_token
Just receiving an id_token is not sufficient to authenticate the user; you must validate the id_token's signature and verify the claims in the token per your app's requirements.  The v2.0 endpoint uses [JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)](http://self-issued.info/docs/draft-ietf-oauth-json-web-token.html) and public key cryptography to sign tokens and verify that they are valid.

You can choose to validate the `id_token` in client code, but a common practice is to send the `id_token` to a backend server and perform the validation there.  Once you've validated the signature of the id_token, there are a few claims you will be required to verify.  See the [v2.0 token reference](active-directory-v2-tokens.md) for more information, including [Validating Tokens](active-directory-v2-tokens.md#validating-tokens) and [Important Information About Signing Key Rollover](active-directory-v2-tokens.md#validating-tokens).  We recommend making use of a library for parsing and validating tokens - there is at least one available for most languages and platforms.
<!--TODO: Improve the information on this-->

You may also wish to validate additional claims depending on your scenario.  Some common validations include:

* Ensuring the user/organization has signed up for the app.
* Ensuring the user has proper authorization/privileges
* Ensuring a certain strength of authentication has occurred, such as multi-factor authentication.

For more information on the claims in an id_token, see the [v2.0 endpoint token reference](active-directory-v2-tokens.md).

Once you have completely validated the id_token, you can begin a session with the user and use the claims in the id_token to obtain information about the user in your app.  This information can be used for display, records, authorizations, etc.

## Get access tokens
Now that you've signed the user into your single page app, you can get access tokens for calling web APIs secured by Azure AD, such as the [Microsoft Graph](https://graph.microsoft.io).  Even if you already received a token using the `token` response_type, you can use this method to acquire tokens to additional resources without having to redirect the user to sign in again.

In the normal OpenID Connect/OAuth flow, you would do this by making a request to the v2.0 `/token` endpoint.  However, the v2.0 endpoint does not support CORS requests, so making AJAX calls to get and refresh tokens is out of the question.  Instead, you can use the implicit flow in a hidden iframe to get new tokens for other web APIs: 

```
// Line breaks for legibility only

https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant}/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?
client_id=6731de76-14a6-49ae-97bc-6eba6914391e
&response_type=token
&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%2Fmyapp%2F
&scope=https%3A%2F%2Fgraph.microsoft.com%2Fmail.read&response_mode=fragment
&state=12345&nonce=678910
&prompt=none
&domain_hint=organizations
&login_hint=myuser@mycompany.com
```

> [!TIP]
> Try copy & pasting the below request into a browser tab! (Don't forget to replace the `domain_hint` and the `login_hint` values with the correct values for your user)

```
https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?client_id=6731de76-14a6-49ae-97bc-6eba6914391e&response_type=token&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%2Fmyapp%2F&scope=https%3A%2F%2Fgraph.microsoft.com%2Fmail.read&response_mode=fragment&state=12345&nonce=678910&prompt=none&domain_hint={{consumers-or-organizations}}&login_hint={{your-username}}
```

| Parameter |  | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| tenant |required |The `{tenant}` value in the path of the request can be used to control who can sign into the application.  The allowed values are `common`, `organizations`, `consumers`, and tenant identifiers.  For more detail, see [protocol basics](active-directory-v2-protocols.md#endpoints). |
| client_id |required |The Application Id that the registration portal ([apps.dev.microsoft.com](https://apps.dev.microsoft.com)) assigned your app. |
| response_type |required |Must include `id_token` for OpenID Connect sign-in.  It may also include other response_types, such as `code`. |
| redirect_uri |recommended |The redirect_uri of your app, where authentication responses can be sent and received by your app.  It must exactly match one of the redirect_uris you registered in the portal, except it must be url encoded. |
| scope |required |A space-separated list of scopes.  For getting tokens, include all [scopes](active-directory-v2-scopes.md) you require for the resource of interest. |
| response_mode |recommended |Specifies the method that should be used to send the resulting token back to your app.  Can be one of `query`, `form_post`, or `fragment`. |
| state |recommended |A value included in the request that will also be returned in the token response.  It can be a string of any content that you wish.  A randomly generated unique value is typically used for preventing cross-site request forgery attacks.  The state is also used to encode information about the user's state in the app before the authentication request occurred, such as the page or view they were on. |
| nonce |required |A value included in the request, generated by the app, that will be included in the resulting id_token as a claim.  The app can then verify this value to mitigate token replay attacks.  The value is typically a randomized, unique string that can be used to identify the origin of the request. |
| prompt |required |For refreshing & getting tokens in a hidden iframe, you should use `prompt=none` to ensure that the iframe does not hang on the v2.0 sign in page, and returns immediately. |
| login_hint |required |For refreshing & getting tokens in a hidden iframe, you must include the username of the user in this hint in order to distinguish between multiple sessions the user may have at a given point in time. You can extract the username from a previous sign-in using the `preferred_username` claim. |
| domain_hint |required |Can be one of `consumers` or `organizations`.  For refreshing & getting tokens in a hidden iframe, you must include the domain_hint in the request.  You should extract the `tid` claim from the id_token of a previous sign-in to determine which value to use.  If the `tid` claim value is `9188040d-6c67-4c5b-b112-36a304b66dad`, you should use `domain_hint=consumers`.  Otherwise, use `domain_hint=organizations`. |

Thanks to the `prompt=none` parameter, this request will either succeed or fail immediately and return to your application.  A successful response will be sent to your app at the indicated `redirect_uri`, using the method specified in the `response_mode` parameter.

#### Successful response
A successful response using `response_mode=fragment` looks like:

```
GET https://localhost/myapp/#
access_token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsIng1dCI6Ik5HVEZ2ZEstZnl0aEV1Q...
&state=12345
&token_type=Bearer
&expires_in=3599
&scope=https%3A%2F%2Fgraph.windows.net%2Fdirectory.read
```

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| access_token |The token that the app requested. |
| token_type |Will always be `Bearer`. |
| state |If a state parameter is included in the request, the same value should appear in the response. The  app should verify that the state values in the request and response are identical. |
| expires_in |How long the access token is valid (in seconds). |
| scope |The scopes that the access token is valid for. |

#### Error response
Error responses may also be sent to the `redirect_uri` so the app can handle them appropriately.  In the case of `prompt=none`, an expected error will be:

```
GET https://localhost/myapp/#
error=user_authentication_required
&error_description=the+request+could+not+be+completed+silently
```

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| error |An error code string that can be used to classify types of errors that occur, and can be used to react to errors. |
| error_description |A specific error message that can help a developer identify the root cause of an authentication error. |

If you receive this error in the iframe request, the user must interactively sign in again to retrieve a new token.  You can choose to handle this case in whatever way makes sense for your application.

## Refreshing tokens
Both `id_token`s and `access_token`s will expire after a short period of time, so your app must be prepared to refresh these tokens periodically.  To refresh either type of token, you can perform the same hidden iframe request from above using the `prompt=none` parameter to control Azure AD's behavior.  If you want to receive a new `id_token`, be sure to use `response_type=id_token` and `scope=openid`, as well as a `nonce` parameter.

## Send a sign out request
The OpenIdConnect `end_session_endpoint` is not currently supported by the v2.0 endpoint. This means your app cannot send a request to the v2.0 endpoint to end a user's session and clear cookies set by the v2.0 endpoint.
To sign a user out, your app can simply end its own session with the user, and leave the user's session with the v2.0 endpoint in-tact.  The next time the user tries to sign in, they will see a "choose account" page, with their actively signed-in accounts listed.
On that page, the user can choose to sign out of any account, ending the session with the v2.0 endpoint.

<!--

When you wish to sign the user out of the  app, it is not sufficient to clear your app's cookies or otherwise end the session with the user.  You must also redirect the user to the v2.0 endpoint for sign out.  If you fail to do so, the user will be able to re-authenticate to your app without entering their credentials again, because they will have a valid single sign-on session with the v2.0 endpoint.

You can simply redirect the user to the `end_session_endpoint` listed in the OpenID Connect metadata document:

```
GET https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/logout?
post_logout_redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%2Fmyapp%2F
```

| Parameter | | Description |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------ |
| post_logout_redirect_uri | recommended | The URL which the user should be redirected to after successful logout.  If not included, the user will be shown a generic message by the v2.0 endpoint.  |
