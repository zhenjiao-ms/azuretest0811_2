# Hybrid Identity directory integration tools comparison
Over the years the directory integration tools have grown and evolved.  This document is to help provide a consolidated view of these tools and a comparison of the features that are available in each.

<!-- The hardcoded link is a workaround for campaign ids not working in acom links-->

> [!NOTE]
> Azure AD Connect incorporates the components and functionality previously released as Dirsync and AAD Sync. These tools are no longer being released individually, and all future improvements will be included in updates to Azure AD Connect, so that you always know where to get the most current functionality.
> 
> DirSync and Azure AD Sync are deprecated. More information can be found in [Upgrade Windows Azure Active Directory Sync (“DirSync”) and Azure Active Directory Sync (“Azure AD Sync”)](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/active-directory-aadconnect-dirsync-deprecated/?WT.mc_id=DirSyncDepACOM).
