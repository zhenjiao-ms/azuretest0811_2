# Reset the password for a user
Whether you're responding to a user requesting a password reset after a lockout, or just attending to routine security maintenance, sometimes you need to reset a user's password. Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) makes this easy.

1. Open your directory.
2. Select the **Users** tab, and then select the display name of the user you want to change.
3. In the command bar, select **Reset Password**.
4. In the reset password dialog, click **reset**.
5. Select the check mark to finish resetting the password.
