# Getting Started With WEB-API for Node
[!INCLUDE [active-directory-devguide](../../includes/active-directory-devguide.md)]

**Passport** is authentication middleware for Node.js. Extremely flexible and modular, Passport can be unobtrusively dropped in to any Express-based or Resitify web application. A comprehensive set of strategies support authentication using a username and password, Facebook, Twitter, and more. We have developed a strategy for Microsoft Azure Active Directory. We will install this module and then add the Microsoft Azure Active Directory `passport-azure-ad` plug-in.

In order to do this, you’ll need to:

1. Register an application with Azure AD
2. Set up your app to use Passport's azure-ad-passport plug-in.
3. Configure a client application to call the To Do List Web API

The code for this tutorial is maintained [on GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-node-webapi). 

> [!NOTE]
> This article does not cover how to implement sign-in, sign-up and profile management with Azure AD B2C.  It focuses on calling web APIs after the user is already authenticated.  If you haven't already, you should start with the [How to integrate with Azure Active Directory document](active-directory-how-to-integrate.md) to learn about the basics of Azure Active Directory.
> 
> 

We've released all of the source code for this running example in GitHub under an MIT license, so feel free to clone (or even better, fork!) and provide feedback and pull requests.

## About Node.js Modules
We will be using Node.js modules in this walkthrough. Modules are loadable JavaScript packages that provide specific functionality for your application. You usually install modules by using the Node.js NPM command-line tool in the NPM installation directory, but some modules, such as the HTTP module, are included the core Node.js package.
Installed modules are saved in the node_modules directory at the root of your Node.js installation directory. Each module in the node_modules directory maintains its own node_modules directory that contains any modules that it depends on, and each required module has a node_modules directory. This recursive directory structure represents the dependency chain.

This dependency chain structure results in a larger application footprint, but it guarantees that all dependencies are met and that the version of the modules used in development will also be used in production. This makes the production app behavior more predictable and prevents versioning problems that might affect users.

## 1. Register a Azure AD Tenant
To use this sample you will need a Azure Active Directory Tenant. If you're not sure what a tenant is or how you would get one, see  [How to get an Azure AD tenant](active-directory-howto-tenant.md).

## 2. Create an application
Now you need to create an app in your directory, which gives Azure AD some information that it needs to securely communicate with your app.  Both the client app and web API will be represented by a single **Application ID** in this case, since they comprise one logical app.  To create an app,
follow [these instructions](active-directory-how-applications-are-added.md). If you are building a Line of Business app [these additional instructions may be useful](active-directory-applications-guiding-developers-for-lob-applications.md).

Be sure to:

* Sign into the Azure Management Portal.
* In the left hand nav, click on **Active Directory**.
* Select the tenant where you wish to register the application.
* Click the **Applications** tab, and click add in the bottom drawer.
* Follow the prompts and create a new **Web Application and/or WebAPI**.
  * The **name** of the application will describe your application to end-users
  * The **Sign-On URL** is the base URL of your app.  The sample code's default is `https://localhost:8080`.
  * The **App ID URI** is a unique identifier for your application.  The convention is to use `https://<tenant-domain>/<app-name>`, e.g. `https://contoso.onmicrosoft.com/my-first-aad-app`
* Once you’ve completed registration, AAD will assign your app a unique client identifier.  You’ll need this value in the next sections, so copy it from the Configure tab.
* REMINDER:Create an **Application Secret** for your application and copy it down.  You will need it shortly.
* REMINDER: Copy down the **Application ID** that is assigned to your app.  You will also need it shortly.

## 3. Download node.js for your platform
To successfully use this sample, you must have a working installation of Node.js.

Install Node.js from [http://nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org).

## 4. Install MongoDB on to your platform
To successfully use this sample, you must have a working installation of MongoDB. We will use MongoDB to make our REST API persistant across server instances.

Install MongoDB from [http://mongodb.org](http://www.mongodb.org).

> [!NOTE]
> This walkthrough assumes that you use the default installation and server endpoints for MongoDB, which at the time of this writing is: mongodb://localhost
> 
> 

## 5. Install the Restify modules in to your Web API
We will be using Resitfy to build our REST API. Restify is a minimal and flexible Node.js application framework derived from Express that has a robust set of features for building REST APIs on top of Connect.

### Install Restify
From the command-line, change directories to the azuread directory. If the **azuread** directory does not exist, create it.

`cd azuread - or- mkdir azuread; cd azuread`

Type the following command:

`npm install restify`

This command installs Restify.

#### DID YOU GET AN ERROR?
When using npm on some operating systems, you may receive an error of Error: EPERM, chmod '/usr/local/bin/..' and a request to try running the account as an administrator. If this occurs, use the sudo command to run npm at a higher privilege level.

#### DID YOU GET AN ERROR REGARDING DTRACE?
You may see something like this when installing Restify:

```Shell
clang: error: no such file or directory: 'HD/azuread/node_modules/restify/node_modules/dtrace-provider/libusdt'
make: *** [Release/DTraceProviderBindings.node] Error 1
gyp ERR! build error
gyp ERR! stack Error: `make` failed with exit code: 2
gyp ERR! stack     at ChildProcess.onExit (/usr/local/lib/node_modules/npm/node_modules/node-gyp/lib/build.js:267:23)
gyp ERR! stack     at ChildProcess.EventEmitter.emit (events.js:98:17)
gyp ERR! stack     at Process.ChildProcess._handle.onexit (child_process.js:789:12)

gyp ERR! node -v v0.10.11
gyp ERR! node-gyp -v v0.10.0
gyp ERR! not ok
npm WARN optional dep failed, continuing dtrace-provider@0.2.8
```


Restify provides a powerful mechanism to trace REST calls using DTrace. However, many operating systems do not have DTrace available. You can safely ignore these errors.

The output of this command should appear similar to the following:

    restify@2.6.1 node_modules/restify
    ├── assert-plus@0.1.4
    ├── once@1.3.0
    ├── deep-equal@0.0.0

    └── bunyan@0.22.0 (mv@0.0.5)


## 6. Install Passport.js in to your Web API
[Passport](http://passportjs.org/) is authentication middleware for Node.js. Extremely flexible and modular, Passport can be unobtrusively dropped in to any Express-based or Resitify web application. A comprehensive set of strategies support authentication using a username and password, Facebook, Twitter, and more. We have developed a strategy for Azure Active Directory. We will install this module and then add the Azure Active Directory strategy plug-in.

From the command-line, change directories to the azuread directory.

Enter the following command to install passport.js

`npm install passport`

The output of the commadn should appear similar to the following:

    passport@0.1.17 node_modules\passport
    ├── pause@0.0.1
    └── pkginfo@0.2.3

## 7. Add Passport-Azure-AD to your Web API
Next, we will add the OAuth strategy, using passport-azuread, a suite of strategies that connect Azure Active Directory with  Passport. We will use this strategy for Bearer Tokens in this Rest API sample.

> [!NOTE]
> Although OAuth2 provides a framework in which any known token type can be issued, only certain token types have gained wide-spread use. For protecting endpoints, that has turned out to be Bearer Tokens. Bearer tokens are the most widely issued type of token in OAuth2, and many implementations assume that bearer tokens are the only type of token issued.

From the command-line, change directories to the azuread directory

Type the following command to install Passport.js passport-azure-ad module:

`npm install passport-azure-ad`

The output of the command should appear similar to the following:

    ``
    passport-azure-ad@1.0.0 node_modules/passport-azure-ad
    ├── xtend@4.0.0
    ├── xmldom@0.1.19

    └── xml2js@0.4.9 (sax@0.6.1, xmlbuilder@2.6.4)



## 8. Add MongoDB modules to your Web API
We will be using MongoDB as our datastore For that reason, we need to install both the widely used plug-in to manage models and schemas called Mongoose, as well as the database driver for MongoDB, also called MongoDB.

* `npm install mongoose`

## 9.  Install additional modules
Next, we'll install the remaining required modules.

From the command-line, change directories to the **azuread** folder if not already there:

`cd azuread`

Enter the following commands to install the following modules in your node_modules directory:

* `npm install assert-plus`
* `npm install bunyan`
* `npm update`

## 10. Create a server.js with your dependencies
The server.js file will be providing the majority of our functionality for our Web API server. We will be adding most of our code to this file. For production purposes you would refactor the functionality in to smaller files, such as separate routes and controllers. For the purpose of this demo we will use server.js for this functionality.

From the command-line, change directories to the **azuread** folder if not already there:

`cd azuread`

Create a `server.js` file in our favorite editor and add the following information:

```Javascript
    'use strict';

    /**
     * Module dependencies.
     */

    var fs = require('fs');
    var path = require('path');
    var util = require('util');
    var assert = require('assert-plus');
    var bunyan = require('bunyan');
    var getopt = require('posix-getopt');
    var mongoose = require('mongoose/');
    var restify = require('restify');
    var passport = require('passport');
  var BearerStrategy = require('passport-azure-ad').BearerStrategy;
```

Save the file. We will return to it shortly.

## 11:. Create a config file to store your Azure AD settings
This code file passes the configuration parameters from your Azure Active Directory Portal to Passport.js. You created these configuration values when you added the Web API to the portal in the first part of the walkthrough. We will explain what to put in the values of these parameters after you've copied the code.

From the command-line, change directories to the **azuread** folder if not already there:

`cd azuread`

Create a `config.js` file in our favorite editor and add the following information:

```Javascript
 exports.creds = {
     mongoose_auth_local: 'mongodb://localhost/tasklist', // Your mongo auth uri goes here
     clientID: 'your client ID',
     audience: 'your application URL',
    // you cannot have users from multiple tenants sign in to your server unless you use the common endpoint
  // example: https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/.well-known/openid-configuration
     identityMetadata: 'https://login.microsoftonline.com/<your tenant id>/.well-known/openid-configuration', 
     validateIssuer: true, // if you have validation on, you cannot have users from multiple tenants sign in to your server
     passReqToCallback: false,
     loggingLevel: 'info' // valid are 'info', 'warn', 'error'. Error always goes to stderr in Unix.

 };


```
Save the file. 

## 12. Add configuration to your server.js file
We need to read these values from the Config file you just created across our application. To do this, we simply add the .config file as a required resource in our application and then set the global variables to those in the config.js document

From the command-line, change directories to the **azuread** folder if not already there:

`cd azuread`

Open your `server.js` file in our favorite editor and add the following information:

```Javascript
var config = require('./config');
```
Then, add a new section to `server.js` with the following code:

```Javascript
var options = {
    // The URL of the metadata document for your app. We will put the keys for token validation from the URL found in the jwks_uri tag of the in the metadata.
    identityMetadata: config.creds.identityMetadata,
    clientID: config.creds.clientID,
    validateIssuer: config.creds.validateIssuer,
    audience: config.creds.audience,
    passReqToCallback: config.creds.passReqToCallback,
    loggingLevel: config.creds.loggingLevel

};

// array to hold logged in users and the current logged in user (owner)
var users = [];
var owner = null;

// Our logger
var log = bunyan.createLogger({
    name: 'Azure Active Directory Bearer Sample',
         streams: [
        {
            stream: process.stderr,
            level: "error",
            name: "error"
        }, 
        {
            stream: process.stdout,
            level: "warn",
            name: "console"
        }, ]
});

  // if logging level specified, switch to it.
  if (config.creds.loggingLevel) { log.levels("console", config.creds.loggingLevel); }

// MongoDB setup
// Setup some configuration
var serverPort = process.env.PORT || 8080;
var serverURI = (process.env.PORT) ? config.creds.mongoose_auth_mongohq : config.creds.mongoose_auth_local;
```

Save the file. 

## 13. Add The MongoDB Model and Schema Information using Moongoose
Now all this preparation is going to start paying off as we wind these three files together in to a REST API service.

For this walkthrough we will be using MongoDB to store our Tasks as discussed in ***Step 4***.

If you recall from the `config.js` file we created in ***Step 11*** we called our database `tasklist` as that was what we put at the end of our mogoose_auth_local connection URL. You don't need to create this database beforehand in MongoDB, it will create this for us on first run of our server application (assuming it does not already exist).

Now that we've told the server what MongoDB database we'd like to use, we need to write some additional code to create the model and schema for our server's Tasks.

#### Discussion of the model
Our Schema model is very simple, and you expand it as required.

NAME - The name of who is assigned to the task. A ***String***

TASK - The task itself. A ***String***

DATE - The date that the task is due. A ***DATETIME***

COMPLETED - If the Task is completed or not. A ***BOOLEAN***

#### Creating the schema in the code
From the command-line, change directories to the **azuread** folder if not already there:

`cd azuread`

Open your `server.js` file in our favorite editor and add the following information below the configuration entry:

```Javascript
// Connect to MongoDB
global.db = mongoose.connect(serverURI);
var Schema = mongoose.Schema;
log.info('MongoDB Schema loaded');

// Here we create a schema to store our tasks and users. Pretty simple schema for now.
var TaskSchema = new Schema({
    owner: String,
    task: String,
    completed: Boolean,
    date: Date
});

// Use the schema to register a model
mongoose.model('Task', TaskSchema);
var Task = mongoose.model('Task');
```
As you can tell from the code, we create our Schema and then create a model object we will use to store our data throughout the code when we define our ***Routes***.

## 14. Add our Routes for our Task REST API server
Now that we have a database model to work with, let's add the routes we will use for our REST API server.

### About Routes in Restify
Routes work in Restify in the exact same way they do using the Express stack. You define routes using the URI that you expect the client applicaitons to call. Usually, you define your routes in a separate file. For our purposes, we will put our routes in the server.js file. We recommend you factor these in to their own file for production use.

A typical pattern for a Restify Route is:

```Javascript
function createObject(req, res, next) {

// do work on Object

 _object.name = req.params.object; // passed value is in req.params under object

 ///...

return next(); // keep the server going
}

....

server.post('/service/:add/:object', createObject); // calls createObject on routes that match this.

```


This is the pattern at the most basic level. Resitfy (and Express) provide much deeper functionaltiy such as defining application types and doing complex routing across different endpoints. For our purposes, we will keep these routes very simply.

### 1. Add default routes to our server
We will now add the basic CRUD routes of Create, Retrieve, Update, and Delete.

From the command-line, change directories to the **azuread** folder if not already there:

`cd azuread`

Open your `server.js` file in our favorite editor and add the following information below the database entries you made above:

```Javascript

/**
 *
 * APIs for our REST Task server
 */

// Create a task

function createTask(req, res, next) {

    // Resitify currently has a bug which doesn't allow you to set default headers
    // This headers comply with CORS and allow us to mongodbServer our response to any origin

    res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*");
    res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "X-Requested-With");

    // Create a new task model, fill it up and save it to Mongodb
    var _task = new Task();

    if (!req.params.task) {
        req.log.warn('createTodo: missing task');
        next(new MissingTaskError());
        return;
    }

    _task.owner = owner;
    _task.task = req.params.task;
    _task.date = new Date();

    _task.save(function(err) {
        if (err) {
            req.log.warn(err, 'createTask: unable to save');
            next(err);
        } else {
            res.send(201, _task);

        }
    });

    return next();

}


// Delete a task by name

function removeTask(req, res, next) {

    Task.remove({
        task: req.params.task,
        owner: owner
    }, function(err) {
        if (err) {
            req.log.warn(err,
                'removeTask: unable to delete %s',
                req.params.task);
            next(err);
        } else {
            log.info('Deleted task:', req.params.task);
            res.send(204);
            next();
        }
    });
}

// Delete all tasks

function removeAll(req, res, next) {
    Task.remove();
    res.send(204);
    return next();
}


// Get a specific task based on name

function getTask(req, res, next) {

    log.info('getTask was called for: ', owner);
    Task.find({
        owner: owner
    }, function(err, data) {
        if (err) {
            req.log.warn(err, 'get: unable to read %s', owner);
            next(err);
            return;
        }

        res.json(data);
    });

    return next();
}

/// Simple returns the list of TODOs that were loaded.

function listTasks(req, res, next) {
    // Resitify currently has a bug which doesn't allow you to set default headers
    // This headers comply with CORS and allow us to mongodbServer our response to any origin

    res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*");
    res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "X-Requested-With");

    log.info("listTasks was called for: ", owner);

    Task.find({
        owner: owner
    }).limit(20).sort('date').exec(function(err, data) {

        if (err) {
            return next(err);
        }

        if (data.length > 0) {
            log.info(data);
        }

        if (!data.length) {
            log.warn(err, "There is no tasks in the database. Did you initalize the database as stated in the README?");
        }

        if (!owner) {
            log.warn(err, "You did not pass an owner when listing tasks.");
        } else {

            res.json(data);

        }
    });

    return next();
}

```

### 2. Next, let's add some Error handling in our APIs:
```

///--- Errors for communicating something interesting back to the client

function MissingTaskError() {
    restify.RestError.call(this, {
        statusCode: 409,
        restCode: 'MissingTask',
        message: '"task" is a required parameter',
        constructorOpt: MissingTaskError
    });

    this.name = 'MissingTaskError';
}
util.inherits(MissingTaskError, restify.RestError);


function TaskExistsError(owner) {
    assert.string(owner, 'owner');

    restify.RestError.call(this, {
        statusCode: 409,
        restCode: 'TaskExists',
        message: owner + ' already exists',
        constructorOpt: TaskExistsError
    });

    this.name = 'TaskExistsError';
}
util.inherits(TaskExistsError, restify.RestError);


function TaskNotFoundError(owner) {
    assert.string(owner, 'owner');

    restify.RestError.call(this, {
        statusCode: 404,
        restCode: 'TaskNotFound',
        message: owner + ' was not found',
        constructorOpt: TaskNotFoundError
    });

    this.name = 'TaskNotFoundError';
}

util.inherits(TaskNotFoundError, restify.RestError);
```


## 15. Create your Server!
We have our database defined, we have our routes in place, and the last thing to do is add our server instance that will manage our calls.

Restify (and Express) have a lot of deep customization you can do for a REST API server, but again we will use the most basic setup for our purposes.

```Javascript
/**
 * Our Server
 */


var server = restify.createServer({
    name: "Azure Active Directroy TODO Server",
    version: "2.0.1"
});

// Ensure we don't drop data on uploads
server.pre(restify.pre.pause());

// Clean up sloppy paths like //todo//////1//
server.pre(restify.pre.sanitizePath());

// Handles annoying user agents (curl)
server.pre(restify.pre.userAgentConnection());

// Set a per request bunyan logger (with requestid filled in)
server.use(restify.requestLogger());

// Allow 5 requests/second by IP, and burst to 10
server.use(restify.throttle({
    burst: 10,
    rate: 5,
    ip: true,
}));

// Use the common stuff you probably want
server.use(restify.acceptParser(server.acceptable));
server.use(restify.dateParser());
server.use(restify.queryParser());
server.use(restify.gzipResponse());
server.use(restify.bodyParser({
    mapParams: true
})); // Allows for JSON mapping to REST
```

## 16. Adding the routes to the server (without authentication for now)
```Javascript
/// Now the real handlers. Here we just CRUD
/**
/*
/* Each of these handlers are protected by our OIDCBearerStrategy by invoking 'oidc-bearer'
/* in the pasport.authenticate() method. We set 'session: false' as REST is stateless and
/* we don't need to maintain session state. You can experiement removing API protection
/* by removing the passport.authenticate() method like so:
/*
/* server.get('/tasks', listTasks);
/*
**/
server.get('/tasks', listTasks);
server.get('/tasks', listTasks);
server.get('/tasks/:owner', getTask);
server.head('/tasks/:owner', getTask);
server.post('/tasks/:owner/:task', createTask);
server.post('/tasks', createTask);
server.del('/tasks/:owner/:task', removeTask);
server.del('/tasks/:owner', removeTask);
server.del('/tasks', removeTask);
server.del('/tasks', removeAll, function respond(req, res, next) {
res.send(204);
next();
});
// Register a default '/' handler

## 17. Before we add OAuth support, let's run the server.
Test out your server before we add authentication

The easiest way to do this is by using curl in a command line. Before we do that, we need a simple utility that allows us to parse output as JSON. To do that, install the json tool as all the examples below use that.

`$npm install -g jsontool`

This installs the JSON tool globally. Now that we’ve accomplished that – let’s play with the server:

First, make sure that your monogoDB isntance is running..

`$sudo mongod`

Then, change to the directory and start curling..

`$ cd azuread`
`$ node server.js`

`$ curl -isS http://127.0.0.1:8080 | json`

```Shell
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Connection: close
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 171
Date: Tue, 14 Jul 2015 05:43:38 GMT
[
"GET /",
"POST /tasks/:owner/:task",
"POST /tasks (for JSON body)",
"GET /tasks",
"PUT /tasks/:owner",
"GET /tasks/:owner",
"DELETE /tasks/:owner/:task"
]
```

Then, we can add a task this way:

`$ curl -isS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/tasks/brandon/Hello`

The response should be:

```Shell
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Connection: close
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: X-Requested-With
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 5
Date: Tue, 04 Feb 2014 01:02:26 GMT
Hello
```
And we can list tasks for Brandon this way:

`$ curl -isS http://127.0.0.1:8080/tasks/brandon/`

If all this works out, we are ready to add OAuth to the REST API server.

**You have a REST API server with MongoDB!**

## 18. Add Authentication to our REST API Server
Now that we have a running REST API (congrats, btw!) let's get to making it useful against Azure AD.

From the command-line, change directories to the **azuread** folder if not already there:

`cd azuread`

### 1: Use the OIDCBearerStrategy that is included with passport-azure-ad
So far we have built a typical REST TODO server without any kind of authorization. This is where we start putting that together.

First, we need to indicate that we want to use Passport. Put this right after your other server configuration:

```Javascript
// Let's start using Passport.js

server.use(passport.initialize()); // Starts passport
server.use(passport.session()); // Provides session support
```

> [!TIP]
> When writing APIs you should always link the data to something unique from the token that the user can’t spoof. When this server stores TODO items, it stores them based on the object ID of the user in the token (called through token.oid) which we put in the “owner” field. This ensures that only that user can access his TODOs and no one else can access the TODOs entered. There is no exposure in the API of “owner” so an external user can request other’s TODOs even if they are authenticated.
> 
> 

Next, let’s use the Bearer strategy that comes with passport-azure-ad. Just look at the code for now, I’ll explain it shortly. Put this after what you pated above:

```Javascript
/**
/*
/* Calling the OIDCBearerStrategy and managing users
/*
/* Passport pattern provides the need to manage users and info tokens
/* with a FindorCreate() method that must be provided by the implementor.
/* Here we just autoregister any user and implement a FindById().
/* You'll want to do something smarter.
**/

var findById = function(id, fn) {
    for (var i = 0, len = users.length; i < len; i++) {
        var user = users[i];
        if (user.sub === id) {
            log.info('Found user: ', user);
            return fn(null, user);
        }
    }
    return fn(null, null);
};


var bearerStrategy = new BearerStrategy(options,
    function(token, done) {
        log.info('verifying the user');
        log.info(token, 'was the token retreived');
        findById(token.sub, function(err, user) {
            if (err) {
                return done(err);
            }
            if (!user) {
                // "Auto-registration"
                log.info('User was added automatically as they were new. Their sub is: ', token.sub);
                users.push(token);
                owner = token.sub;
                return done(null, token);
            }
            owner = token.sub;
            return done(null, user, token);
        });
    }
);

passport.use(bearerStrategy);
```

Passport uses a similar pattern for all it’s Strategies (Twitter, Facebook, etc.) that all Strategy writers adhere to. Looking at the strategy you see we pass it a function() that has a token and a done as the parameters. The strategy will dutifully come back to us once it does all it’s work. Once it does we’ll want to store the user and stash the token so we won’t need to ask for it again.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The code above takes any user that happens to authenticate to our server. This is known as auto registration. In production servers you wouldn’t want to let anyone in without first having them go through a registration process you decide. This is usually the pattern you see in consumer apps who allow you to register with Facebook but then ask you to fill out additional information. If this wasn’t a command line program, we could have just extracted the email from the token object that is returned and then asked them to fill out additional information. Since this is a test server we simply add them to the in-memory database.

### 2. Finally, protect some endpoints
You protect endpoints by specifying the `passport.authenticate()` call with the protocol you wish to use.

Let’s edit our route in our server code to do something more interesting:

```Javascript
server.get('/tasks', passport.authenticate('oauth-bearer', {
session: false
}), listTasks);
server.get('/tasks', passport.authenticate('oauth-bearer', {
session: false
}), listTasks);
server.get('/tasks/:owner', passport.authenticate('oauth-bearer', {
session: false
}), getTask);
server.head('/tasks/:owner', passport.authenticate('oauth-bearer', {
session: false
}), getTask);
server.post('/tasks/:owner/:task', passport.authenticate('oauth-bearer', {
session: false
}), createTask);
server.post('/tasks', passport.authenticate('oauth-bearer', {
session: false
}), createTask);
server.del('/tasks/:owner/:task', passport.authenticate('oauth-bearer', {
session: false
}), removeTask);
server.del('/tasks/:owner', passport.authenticate('oauth-bearer', {
session: false
}), removeTask);
server.del('/tasks', passport.authenticate('oauth-bearer', {
session: false
}), removeTask);
server.del('/tasks', passport.authenticate('oauth-bearer', {
session: false
}), removeAll, function respond(req, res, next) {
res.send(204);
next();
});
```

## 19. Run your server application again and ensure it rejects you
Let's use `curl` again to see if we now have OAuth2 protection against our endpoints. We will do this before runnning any of our client SDKs against this endpoint. The headers returned should be enough to tell us we are down the right path.

First, make sure that your monogoDB instance is running:

  $sudo mongod

Then, change to the directory and start curling..

  $ cd azuread
  $ node server.js

Try a basic POST:

`$ curl -isS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/tasks/brandon/Hello`

```Shell
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
Connection: close
WWW-Authenticate: Bearer realm="Users"
Date: Tue, 14 Jul 2015 05:45:03 GMT
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
```

A 401 is the response you are looking for here, as that indicates that the Passport layer is trying to redirect to the authorize endpoint, which is exactly what you want.

## Congratulations! You have a REST API Service using OAuth2!
You've went as far as you can with this server without using an OAuth2 compatible client. You will need to go through an additional walkthrough.

If you were just looking for information on how to implement a REST API using Restify and OAuth2, you have more than enough code to keep developing your service and learning how to build on this example.

If you are interested in the next steps in your ADAL journey, here are some supported ADAL clients we recommend for you to keep working:

Simply clone down to your developer machine and configure as stated in the Walkthrough.
