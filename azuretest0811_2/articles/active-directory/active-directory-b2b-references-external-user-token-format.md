# Azure AD B2B collaboration preview: External user token format
The claims for a standard Azure AD token are described in the [Supported Token and Claim Types](active-directory-token-and-claims.md) article on azure.microsoft.com.

The claims that are different for an authenticated B2B collaboration external user are as follows:<br/>

* **OID:** the object ID from the resource tenant<br/>
* **TID**: tenant ID from the resource tenant<br/>
* **Issuer**: this is the resource tenant<br/>
* **IDP**: this is the home tenant of the user<br/>
* **AltSecId**: this is the alternative security ID, which is opaque to you<br/>
