# How to use the audit log in Azure AD Privileged Identity Management
You can use the Privileged Identity Management (PIM) audit log to see all of the user assignments and activations within a given time period.

## Navigate to the audit log
From the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) dashboard, select the **Azure AD Priviliged Identity Management** app. From there, access the audit log by clicking **Manage privileged roles** > **Audit history** in the PIM dashboard.

## The audit log graph
You can use the audit log to view the total activations, max activations per day, and average activations per day in a line graph.  You can also filter the data by role if there is more than one role in the audit history.

Use the **time**, **action**, and **role** buttons to sort the log.

## The audit log list
The columns in the audit log list are:

* **Requestor** - the user who requested the role activation or change.  If the value is "Azure System", check the Azure audit log for more information.
* **User** - the user who is activating or assigned to a role.
* **Role** - the role assigned or activated by the user.
* **Action** - the actions taken by the requestor. This can include assignment, unassignment, activation, or deactivation.
* **Time** - when the action occurred.
* **Reasoning** - if any text was entered into the reason field during activation, it will show up here.
* **Expiration** - only relevant for activation of roles.

## Filter the audit log
You can filter the information that shows up in the audit log by clicking the **Filter** button.  The **Update chart parameters blade** will appear.

After you set the filters, click **Update** to filter the data in the log.  If the data doesn't appear right away, refresh the page.

### Change the date range
Use the **Today**, **Past Week**, **Past Month**, or **Custom** buttons to change the time range of the audit log.

When you choose the **Custom** button, you will be given a **From** date field and a **To** date field to specify a range of dates for the log.  You can either enter the dates in MM/DD/YYYY format or click on the **calendar** icon and choose the date from a calendar.

### Change the roles included in the log
Check or uncheck the **Role** checkbox next to each role to include or exclude it from the log.
