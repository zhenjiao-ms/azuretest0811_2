# How to add or change Azure administrator roles
There are three kinds of administrator roles in Microsoft Azure:

| Administrative role | Limit | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Account Administrator (AA) |1 per Azure account |This is the person who signed up for or bought Azure subscriptions, and is authorized to access the [Account Center](https://account.windowsazure.com/Home/Index) and perform various management tasks. These include being able to create subscriptions, cancel subscriptions, change the billing for a subscription, and change the Service Administrator. |
| Service Administrator (SA) |1 per Azure subscription |This role is authorized to manage services in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). By default, for a new subscription, the Account Administrator is also the Service Administrator. |
| Co-administrator (CA) in the [Azure classic portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com) |200 per subscription |This role has the same access privileges as the Service Administrator, but canâ€™t change the association of subscriptions to Azure directories. |

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Active Directory Role-based Access Control (RBAC) allows users to be added to multiple roles. For more information, see [Azure Active Directory Role-based Access Control](active-directory/role-based-access-control-configure.md).

## How to add an admin for a subscription
**Azure portal**

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. On the Hub menu, select **Subscription** > *the subscription that you want the admin to access*.
   
    ![newselectsub](./media/billing-add-change-azure-subscription-administrator/newselectsub.png)
3. In the subscription blade, select **Settings**> **Users**.
   
    ![newsettings](./media/billing-add-change-azure-subscription-administrator/newsettings.png)
4. In the Users blade, select **Add**>**Select a role** > **Owner**.
   
    ![newselectrole](./media/billing-add-change-azure-subscription-administrator/newselectrole.png)
   
    **Note**
   
   * The owner role has same access privileges as co-administrator. This role does not have access privilege to the [Azure Account Center](https://account.windowsazure.com/subscriptions).
   * The owners you added through the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) cannot manage services in the [Azure classic portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com).  
5. Type the email address of the user you want to add as owner, click the user, and then click **Select**.
   
    ![newadduser](./media/billing-add-change-azure-subscription-administrator/newadduser.png)

**Azure classic portal**

1. Sign in to the [Azure classic portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com/).
2. In the navigation pane, select **Settings**> **Administrators**> **Add**. </br>
   
    ![addcodmin](./media/billing-add-change-azure-subscription-administrator/addcoadmin.png)
3. Type the email address of the person you want to add as Co-administrator and then select the subscription that you want the Co-administrator to access.</br>
   
    ![addcoadmin2](./media/billing-add-change-azure-subscription-administrator/addcoadmin2.png)</br>

The following email address can be added as a Co-Administrator:

* **Microsoft Account** (formerly Windows Live ID) </br>
  You can use a Microsoft Account to sign in to all consumer-oriented Microsoft products and cloud services, such as Outlook (Hotmail), Skype (MSN), OneDrive, Windows Phone, and Xbox LIVE.
* **Organizational account**</br>
  An organizational account is an account that is created under Azure Active Directory. The organizational account address resembles the following:
    user@&lt;your domain&gt;.onmicrosoft.com

### Limitations and restrictions
* Each subscription is associated with an Azure AD directory (also known as the Default Directory). To find the Default Directory the subscription is associated with, go to the [Azure classic portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com/), select **Settings** > **Subscriptions**. Check the subscription ID to find the Default Directory.
* If you are logged in with a Microsoft Account, you can only add other Microsoft Accounts or users within the Default Directory as Co-Administrator.
* If you are logged in with an organizational account, you can add other organizational accounts in your organization as Co-Administrator. For example, abby@contoso.com can add bob@contoso.com as Service Administrator or Co-Administrator, but cannot add john@notcontoso.com unless john@noncontoso.com is the user in Default Directory. Users logged in with organizational accounts can continue to add Microsoft Account users as Service Administrator or Co-Administrator.
* Now that it is possible to log into Azure with an organizational account, here are the changes to Service Administrator and Co-administrator account requirements:
  
  | Login Method | Add Microsoft Account or users within Default Directory as CA or SA? | Add organizational account in the same organization as CA or SA? | Add organizational account in different organization as CA or SA? |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  |  Microsoft Account |Yes |No |No |
  |  Organizational Account |Yes |Yes |No |

## How to change Service Administrator for a subscription
Only the Account Administrator can change the Service Administrator for a subscription.

1. Log on into [Azure Account Center](https://account.windowsazure.com/subscriptions) by using the Account Administrator.
2. Select the subscription you want to change.
3. On the right side, click **Edit subscription** details. </br>
   
    ![editsub](./media/billing-add-change-azure-subscription-administrator/editsub.png)
4. In the **SERVICE ADMINISTRATOR** box, enter the email address of the new Service Administrator. </br>

## How to change the Account Administrator
