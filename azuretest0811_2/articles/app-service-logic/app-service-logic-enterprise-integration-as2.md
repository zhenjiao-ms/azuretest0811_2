# Enterprise integration with AS2
## Create an AS2 agreement
In order to use the enterprise features in Logic apps, you must first create agreements. 

### Here's what you need before you get started
* An [integration account](app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-accounts.md) defined in your Azure subscription  
* At least two [partners](app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-partners.md) already defined in your integration account  

> [!NOTE]
> When creating an agreement, the content in the agreement file must match the agreement type.    
> 
> 

After you've [created an integration account](app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-accounts.md) and [added partners](app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-partners.md), you can create an agreement by following these steps:  

### From the Azure portal home page
After you log into the [Azure portal](http://portal.azure.com "Azure portal"):  

1. Select **Browse** from the menu on the left.  

> [!TIP]
> If you don't see the **Browse** link, you may need to expand the menu first. Do this by selecting the **Show menu** link that's located at the top left of the collapsed menu.  
> 
>

1. Type *integration* into the filter search box then select **Integration Accounts** from the list of results.       
   ![](./media/app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-overview/overview-2.png)  
2. In the **Integration Accounts** blade that opens up, select the integration account in which you will create the agreement. If you don't see any integration accounts lists, [create one first](app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-accounts.md "All about integration accounts").  
   ![](./media/app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-overview/overview-3.png)  
3. Select the **Agreements** tile. If you don't see the agreements tile, add it first.

4. Select the **Add** button in the Agreements blade that opens.

5. Enter a **Name** for your agreement then select the **Host Partner**, **Host Identity**,  **Guest Partner**, **Guest Identity**, in the Agreements blade that opens.  
   ![](./media/app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-agreements/agreement-3.png)  

Here are a few details you may find useful when configuring the settings for your agreement: 

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Host Partner |An agreement needs both a host and guest partner. The host partner represents the organization that is configuring the agreement. |
| Host Identity |An identifier for the host partner. |
| Guest Partner |An agreement needs both a host and guest partner. The guest partner represents the organization that's doing business with the host partner. |
| Guest Identity |An identifier for the guest partner. |
| Receive Settings |These properties apply to all messages received by an agreement |
| Send Settings |These properties apply to all messages sent by an agreement |

Let's continue:  

1. Select **Receive Settings** to configure how messages received via this agreement are to be handled.  
   
   * Optionally, you can override the properties in the incoming message. To do this, select the **Override message properties** checkbox.
   * Select the **Message should be signed** checkbox if you'd like to require all incoming messages to be signed. If you select this option, you will also need to select the **Certificate** that will be used to validate the signature on the messages.
   * Optionally, you can require messages to be encrypted as well. To do this, select the **Message should be encrypted** checkbox. You would then need to select the **Certificate** that will be used to decode the incoming messages.
   * You can also require messages to be compressed. To do this, select the **Message should be compressed** checkbox.

| Send signed MDN |Enable this to require MDNs to be signed. |
| MIC Algorithm | |
| Send asynchronous MDN |Enable this to require messages to be sent asynchronously. |

Now, let's continue:  

1. Select **Send Settings** to configure how messages sent via this agreement are to be handled.
