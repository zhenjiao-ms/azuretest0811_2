# XML processing
The Enterprise Integration Pack makes it easy to validate and process XML documents that you exchange with business partners. Here are the ways you can process these XML messages using Logic apps:  

* [XML validation](app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-xml-validation.md "Learn about XML message validation")  - XML validation provides the ability to validate a message that originates from a source endpoint against a specific schema.
* [XML transform](app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-transform.md "Learn about XML message transformations and maps") - XML transform provides the ability to convert an XML message based on the requirements of a destination endpoint.   
* [Flat file encoding and flat file decoding](app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-flatfile.md "Learn about flat file encoding/decoding") - Flat file encoding/decoding provides the ability to encode or decode a flat file. 
* [XPath](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt643789.aspx) - Provides the ability to enrich a message and extract specific properties from the message. The extracted properties can then be used to route the message to a destination or an intermediary endpoint.
