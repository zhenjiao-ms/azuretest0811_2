# Get started with the Wait Connector and add it to your Logic App
> [!NOTE]
> We are ending support for this connector because its functionality is now included by default as the **delay action** when you create new Logic apps. We recommend that you upgrade all your Logic apps that are using this connector. This version of the article applies to logic apps 2014-12-01-preview schema version.

Wait connector enables an app to delay its execution for a specified duration or until the occurrence of a specified time. You can add the Wait Connector to your business workflow and process data as part of this workflow within a Logic App. When used in a Logic App, it can be used to delay execution.

## Using Wait Connector
To use the Wait connector, you need to first create an instance of the Wait Connector API app. This can be done either inline while creating a logic app or by selecting the Wait Connector API app from the Azure Marketplace.

## Using Wait Connector in the Logic Apps designer surface
Wait Connector can be used as an action. It does not have any triggers.

### Action
* Click on Wait Connector from the right pane:  
  ![List of Actions](./media/app-service-logic-wait/ListOfActions.PNG)
* Wait Connector supports two actions: 
  
  * Delay
  * Delay Until
* Select *Delay*:

* Provide the inputs for the action and configure it:

| Parameter | Type | Description of the parameter |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Duration In Minutes |integer |Delay duration in minutes |

## Do more with your Connector
Now that the connector is created, you can add it to a business flow using a Logic App. See [What are Logic Apps?](app-service-logic-what-are-logic-apps.md).

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to get started with Azure Logic Apps before signing up for an Azure account, go to [Try Logic App](https://tryappservice.azure.com/?appservice=logic), where you can immediately create a short-lived starter logic app in App Service. No credit cards required; no commitments.
