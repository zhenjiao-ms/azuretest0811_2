# List of Connectors and API Apps to use in your Logic Apps
> [!NOTE]
> This version of the article applies to logic apps 2014-12-01-preview schema version. For the Logic Apps General Availability (GA) version, see [New Connectors List](../connectors/apis-list.md).
> 
> 

Learn about all the available connectors and API Apps created by Microsoft to use within your Logic Apps.

For pricing information and a list of what is included with each Service Tier, see [Azure App Service Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/app-service/).

> [!NOTE]
> To get started with Logic Apps before signing up for an Azure account, go to [Try Logic App](https://tryappservice.azure.com/?appservice=logic). You can immediately create a short-lived starter logic app in App Service. No credit cards required; no commitments.

## Core Connectors
The following table lists all the available connectors and API Apps created by Microsoft that are available as Core Connectors:

## Enterprise Integration Connectors
The following table lists all the available Connectors and API Apps created by Microsoft available as Enterprise Integration Connectors:

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [AS2 Connector](app-service-logic-connector-as2.md) |Can receive and send messages using the AS2 transport protocol. Data is transported securely and reliably using digital certificates and encryption. |
| [BizTalk EDIFACT](app-service-logic-connector-edifact.md) |Receives and sends messages using the EDIFACT protocol in business-to-business communications. |
| [BizTalk Flat File Encoder](app-service-logic-flatfile-encoder.md) |Provides interoperability between flat file data (like excel and csv) and XML data. This API App can convert a flat file instance to XML and vice versa. |
| [BizTalk JSON Encoder](app-service-logic-connector-jsonencoder.md) |An encoder and decoder that helps your app interop between JSON and XML data. It can convert a given JSON instance to XML and vice versa. |
| [BizTalk Rules](app-service-logic-use-biztalk-rules.md) |Use BizTalk Rules to define and control the business logic within an organization. Business policies can be updated without recompiling or without redeploying the associated applications. |
| [BizTalk Trading Partner Management](app-service-logic-connector-tpm.md) |Defines and persists business-to-business relationships using partners, agreements, and schemas and certificates used in agreements. These relationships are enforced using the AS2, EDIFACT, and X12 API Apps. |
| [BizTalk Transform Service](app-service-logic-transform-xml-documents.md) |Converts data from one format to another format. You can also upload an existing map (.trfm file), view the links between the source and target schemas, and use 'Testâ€™ functionality with sample input XML content. Different built-in functions are also available, including string manipulations, conditional assignment, and more. |
| [BizTalk X12](app-service-logic-connector-x12.md) |Receives and sends messages using the X12 protocol in business-to-business communications. |
| [BizTalk XML Validator](app-service-logic-xml-validator.md) |Validates XML data against predefined XML schemas. You can use existing schemas or generate schemas based on a flat file instance, JSON instance, or existing connectors. |

## Connectors as Triggers
Several connectors provide triggers for Logic Apps. These triggers are of two types:

1. Poll Triggers: These triggers poll your service at a specified frequency to check for new data. When new data is available, a new instance of your Logic App runs with the data as input. To prevent the same data from being consumed multiple times, the trigger may clean-up data that has been read and passed to the Logic App. Examples of such connectors are File, SQL, and Azure Storage.
2. Push Triggers: These triggers listen for data on an endpoint or for an event to occur. Then, trigger a new instance of a Logic App. Examples of such connectors are HTTP Listener and Twitter.

## Connectors as Actions
Connectors can also be used as actions within your Logic App. Actions are useful for looking up data within the Logic App that can then used in the execution. For example, you may need to look up data from a SQL database for additional information about a customer when processing an order. Or, you may need to write, update or delete data in a destination. You can do this using the actions provided by the connectors. Actions map to operations in API Apps (as defined by their Swagger metadata).
