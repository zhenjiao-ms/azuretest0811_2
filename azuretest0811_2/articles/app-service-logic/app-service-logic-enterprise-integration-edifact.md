# Enterprise integration with EDIFACT
> [!NOTE]

## Create an EDIFACT agreement
Before you can exchange EDIFACT messages, you need to create an EDIFACT agreement and store it in your integration account. The following steps will walk you through the process of creating an EDIFACT agreement.

### Here's what you need before you get started
* An [integration account](app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-accounts.md) defined in your Azure subscription  
* At least two [partners](app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-partners.md) already defined in your integration account  

> [!NOTE]
> When creating an agreement, the content in the messages you will receive/send to and from the partner must match the agreement type.    
> 
> 

After you've [created an integration account](app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-accounts.md) and [added partners](app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-partners.md), you can create an EDIFACT agreement by following these steps:  

### From the Azure portal home page
After you log into the [Azure portal](http://portal.azure.com "Azure portal"):  

1. Select **Browse** from the menu on the left.  

> [!TIP]
> If you don't see the **Browse** link, you may need to expand the menu first. Do this by selecting the **Show menu** link that's located at the top left of the collapsed menu.  
> 
>

1. Type *integration* into the filter search box then select **Integration Accounts** from the list of results.       
   ![](./media/app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-edifact/EDIFACT-1-3.png)    
2. In the **Integration Accounts** blade that opens up, select the integration account in which you will create the agreement. If you don't see any integration accounts lists, [create one first](app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-accounts.md "All about integration accounts").  
   ![](./media/app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-edifact/EDIFACT-1-4.png)  
3. Select the **Agreements** tile. If you don't see the agreements tile, add it first.   
   ![](./media/app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-edifact/EDIFACT-1-5.png)     
4. Select the **Add** button in the Agreements blade that opens.  
   ![](./media/app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-edifact/EDIFACT-agreement-2.png)  
5. Enter a **Name** for your agreement then select the **Agreement type** for EDIFACT, **Host Partner**, **Host Identity**,  **Guest Partner**, **Guest Identity**, in the Agreements blade that opens.  
   ![](./media/app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-edifact/EDIFACT-1.png)  
6. After you have set the agreement properties, select **Receive Settings** to configure how messages received via this agreement are to be handled.  
7. The Receive Settings control is divided into the following sections, including Identifiers, Acknowledgment, Schemas, Control Numbers, Validation, Internal Settings and Batch processing. Configure these properties based on your agreement with the partner you will be exchanging messages with. Here is a view of these controls, configure them based on how you want this agreement to identify and handle incoming messages:

With this option, if one or more transaction sets in the interchange fail validation, then only those transaction sets are suspended. Split Interchange as Transaction Sets - suspend Interchange on Error: Parses each transaction set in an interchange into a separate XML document by applying the appropriate envelope. With this option, if one or more transaction sets in the interchange fail validation, then the entire interchange will be suspended.</br></br>**Preserve Interchange - suspend Transaction Sets on Error**: Leaves the interchange intact, creating an XML document for the entire batched interchange. With this option, if one or more transaction sets in the interchange fail validation, then only those transaction sets are suspended, while all other transaction sets are processed.</br></br>**Preserve Interchange - suspend Interchange on Error**: Leaves the interchange intact, creating an XML document for the entire batched interchange. With this option, if one or more transaction sets in the interchange fail validation, then the entire interchange is suspended. |
