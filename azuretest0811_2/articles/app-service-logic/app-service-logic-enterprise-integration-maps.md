# Learn about maps and the Enterprise Integration Pack
## Overview
Enterprise integration uses maps to transform XML data from one format to another format. 

## What is a map?
A map is an XML document that defines which data in a document should be transformed into another format. 

## Why use maps?
Let's assume you regularly receive B2B orders or invoices from a customers who uses the YYYMMDD format for dates. However, in your organization, you store dates in the MMDDYYY format. You can use a map to *transform* the YYYMMDD date format into the MMDDYYY before storing the order or invoice details in your customer activity database.

## How to upload a map?
From the Azure portal:  

1. Select **Browse**

7. The map is now being added into your integration account. You will receive an onscreen notification that indicates the success or failure of adding the map file. After you receive the notification, select the **Maps** tile, you will then see your newly added map in the Maps blade:

## How to edit a map?
To edit a map, you must upload a new map file with the changes you desire. You can first download the map and edit it. 

Follow these steps to upload a new map that replaces an existing map:  

1. Select the **Maps** tile  
2. Select the map you wish to edit when the Maps blade opens up  
3. On the **Maps** blade, select the **Update** link  
   ![](./media/app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-maps/edit-1.png)   
4. Select the map file you wish to upload by using the file picker dialog that opens up then select **Open** in the file picker

5. You will receive a notification popup after the map is uploaded.
