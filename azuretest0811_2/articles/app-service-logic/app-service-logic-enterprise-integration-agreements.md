# Learn about agreements and Enterprise Integration Pack
## Overview
Agreements are the cornerstone of business-to-business (B2B) communications, allowing business entities to communicate seamlessly using industry standard protocols.  

## What is an agreement?
An agreement, as far as the Enterprise Integration Pack is concerned, is a communications arrangement between B2B trading partners. An agreement is based on the communications the partners wish to achieve and is protocol or transport specific.

Enterprise integration supports three protocol/transport standards:  

* [AS2](app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-as2.md)
* [X12](app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-x12.md)
* [EDIFACT](app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-edifact.md)

## Why use agreements
Some of the common benefits of using agreements are:

* Enables different organizations and businesses to be able to exchange information in a well known format.  
* Improves efficiency when conducting B2B transactions  
* Easy to create, manage and use them when creating enterprise integration apps  

## How to create agreements

* [Create an X12 agreement](app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-x12.md)   

## How to use an agreement
After creating an agreement, you can use it via the Azure portal to create [Logic apps](app-service-logic-what-are-logic-apps.md "Learn about Logic apps") with B2B features.

## How to edit an agreement

4. Select **Edit** from the menu above   
5. On the Edit menu that opens, make you changes then select the **OK** button to save the changes  

## How to delete an agreement

1. Select the **Agreements** tile  
2. Select the agreement you wish to delete on the **Agreements** blade
