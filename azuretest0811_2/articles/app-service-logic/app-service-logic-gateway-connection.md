# Connect to the on-premises data gateway for Logic Apps
Supported logic apps connectors allow you to configure your connection to access on-premises data via the on-premises data gateway.  The following steps will walk you through how to install and configure the on-premises data gateway to work with a logic app.

## Prerequisites
* Must be using a work or school email address in Azure to associate the on-premises data gateway with your account (Azure Active Directory based account)
  * If you are using a Microsoft Account (e.g. @outlook.com, @live.com) you can use your Azure account to create a work or school email address by [following the steps here](../virtual-machines/virtual-machines-windows-create-aad-work-id.md#locate-your-default-directory-in-the-azure-classic-portal)

> [!WARNING]
> There is a limitation currently that on-premises gateway install will only complete when using an account that has been registered with Power BI.  In the meantime please register any account with "Power BI Free" to complete the installation successfully.
> 
> 

* Must have the on-premises data gateway [installed on a local machine](app-service-logic-gateway-install.md).
* Gateway must not have been claimed by another Azure on-premises data gateway ([claim happens with creation of step 2 below](#2-create-an-azure-on-premises-data-gateway-resource)) - an installation can only be associated to one gateway resource.

## Installing and configuring the connection
### 1. Install the on-premises data gateway
Information on installing the on-premises data gateway can be found [in this article](app-service-logic-gateway-install.md).  The gateway must be installed on an on-premises machine before you can continue with the rest of the steps.

### 2. Create an Azure on-premises data gateway resource
Once installed, you must associate your Azure subscription with the on-premises data gateway.

1. Login to Azure using the same work or school email address that was used during installation of the gateway
2. Click **New** resource button
3. Search and select the **On-premises data gateway**
4. Complete the information to associate the gateway with your account - including selecting the appropriate **Installation Name**

5. Click the **Create** button to create the resource

### 3. Create a logic app connection in the designer
Now that your Azure subscription is associated with an instance of the on-premises data gateway, you can create a connection to it from within a logic app.

1. Open a logic app and choose a connector that supports on-premises connectivity (as of this writing, SQL Server)
2. Select the checkbox for **Connect via on-premises data gateway**

3. Select the **Gateway** to connect to and complete any other connection information required
4. Click **Create** to create the connection

The connection should now be successfully configured for use in your logic app.
