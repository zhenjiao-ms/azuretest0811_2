# We've improved the Twilio connector
We've removed the content (which targeted Logic apps version 2014-12-01-preview) from this page because this connector has been upgraded and is now only supported on the new [Logic Apps schema version 2015-08-01-preview](app-service-logic-schema-2015-08-01.md) and later. 

## Next steps
* [Learn more about the this new connector](../connectors/connectors-create-api-twilio.md)
* See [the full list](../connectors/apis-list.md) of all connectors that run on the new Logic Apps schema version 2015-08-01-preview
