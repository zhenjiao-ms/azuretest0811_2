# Learn about schemas and the Enterprise Integration Pack
## Why use a schema
You use schemas to confirm that XML documents you receive are valid, meaning that the documents contain the expected data in a predefined format.

## How to add a schema
From the Azure portal: 

1. Select **Browse**

8. Select the **Schemas** tile. This refreshes the tile and you should see the number of schemas increase, reflecting the new schema has been added successfully. After you select the **Schemas** tile, you will also see the newly added schema is displayed in the Schemas blade, on the right.
