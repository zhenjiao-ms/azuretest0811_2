## ForEach Loop and Arrays
Logic Apps allows you to loop over a set of data and perform an action for each item.  This is possible via the `foreach` action.  In the designer, you can specify to add a for each loop.  After selecting the array you wish to iterate over, you can begin adding actions.  Currently you are limited to only one action per foreach loop, but this restriction will be lifted in the coming weeks.  Once within the loop you can begin to specify what should occur at each value of the array.

If using code-view, you can specify a for each loop like below.  This is an example of a for each loop that sends an email for each email address that contains 'microsoft.com':

```
{
    "email_filter": {
        "type": "query",
        "inputs": {
            "from": "@triggerBody()['emails']",
            "where": "@contains(item()['email'], 'microsoft.com')
        }
    },
    "forEach_email": {
        "type": "foreach",
        "foreach": "@body('email_filter')",
        "actions": {
            "send_email": {
                "type": "ApiConnection",
                "inputs": {
                "body": {
                    "to": "@item()",
                    "from": "me@contoso.com",
                    "message": "Hello, thank you for ordering"
                }
                "host": {
                    "connection": {
                        "id": "@parameters('$connections')['office365']['connection']['id']"
                    }
                }
                }
            }
        },
        "runAfter":{
            "email_filter": [ "Succeeded" ]
        }
    }
}
```

  A `foreach` action can iterate over arrays up to 5,000 rows.  Each iteration can execute in parallel, so it may be necessary to add messages to a queue if flow control is needed.

## Until Loop
  You can perform an action or series of actions until a condition is met.  The most common scenario for this is calling an endpoint until you get the response you are looking for.  In the designer, you can specify to add an until loop.  After adding actions inside the loop, you can set the exit condition, as well as the loop limits.  There is a 1 minute delay between loop cycles.

  If using code-view, you can specify an until loop like below.  This is an example of calling an HTTP endpoint until the response body has the value 'Completed'.  It will complete when either 

* HTTP Response has status of 'Completed'
* It has tried for 1 hour
* It has looped 100 times
  
  ```
  {
    "until_successful":{
      "type": "until",
      "expression": "@equals(actions('http')['status'], 'Completed'),
      "limit": {
          "count": 100,
          "timeout": "PT1H"
      },
      "actions": {
          "create_resource": {
              "type": "http",
              "inputs": {
                  "url": "http://provisionRseource.com",
                  "body": {
                      "resourceId": "@triggerBody()"
                  }
              }
          }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

## SplitOn and Debatching
Sometimes a trigger may recieve an array of items that you want to debatch and start a workflow per item.  This can be accomplished via the `spliton` command.  By default, if your trigger swagger specifies a payload that is an array, a `spliton` will be added and start a run per item.  SplitOn can only be added to a trigger.  This can be manually configured or overridden in definition code-view.  Currently SplitOn can debatch arrays up to 5,000 items.  You cannot have a `spliton` and also implement the syncronous response pattern.  Any workflow called that has a `response` action in addition to `spliton` will run asyncronously and send an immediate `202 Accepted` response.  

SplitOn can be specified in code-view as the following example.  This recieves an array of items and debatches on each row.

```
{
    "myDebatchTrigger": {
        "type": "Http",
        "inputs": {
            "url": "http://getNewCustomers",
        },
        "recurrence": {
            "frequencey": "Second",
            "interval": 15
        },
        "spliton": "@triggerBody()['rows']"
    }
}
```

## Scopes
It is possible to group a series of actions together using a scope.  This is particularly useful for implementing exception handling.  In the designer you can add a new scope, and begin adding any actions inside of it.  You can define scopes in code-view like the following:

```
{
    "myScope": {
        "type": "scope",
        "actions": {
            "call_bing": {
                "type": "http",
                "inputs": {
                    "url": "http://www.bing.com"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
