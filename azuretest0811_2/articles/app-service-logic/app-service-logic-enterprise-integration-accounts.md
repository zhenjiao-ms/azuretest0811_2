# Overview of integration accounts
## What is an integration account?
An integration account is an Azure account that allows Enterprise Integration apps to manage artifacts including schemas, maps, certificates, partners and agreements. Any integration app you create will need to use an integration account in order to access a schema, map or certificate, for example.

## Create an integration account
1. Select **Browse**   
   ![](./media/app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-accounts/account-1.png)  
2. Enter **integration** in the filter search box and select **Integration Accounts** from the results list     
   ![](./media/app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-accounts/account-2.png)  
3. Select *Add* button from the menu at the top of the page      
   ![](./media/app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-accounts/account-3.png)  
4. Enter the **Name**, select the **Subscription** you want to use, either create a new **Resource group** or select an existing resource group, select a **Location** where your integration account will be hosted, select a **Pricing tier**, then select the **Create** button.   
   
   At this point the integration account will be provisioned in the location you selected. This should complete within 1 minute.
