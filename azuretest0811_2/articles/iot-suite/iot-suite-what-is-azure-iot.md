## Azure IoT Suite
The Microsoft Azure IoT Suite is an enterprise-grade solution that enables you to get started quickly through a set of extensible preconfigured solutions that address common IoT scenarios, such as [remote monitoring](iot-suite-getstarted-preconfigured-solutions.md) and [predictive maintenance](iot-suite-predictive-overview.md). These solutions are implementations of the IoT solution architecture described previously.

The preconfigured solutions are complete, working, end-to-end solutions that include simulated devices to get you started, preconfigured Azure services such as [Azure IoT Hub](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/services/iot-hub/), [Azure Event Hubs](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/services/event-hubs/), [Azure Stream Analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/services/stream-analytics/), [Azure Machine Learning](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/services/machine-learning/), and [Azure storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/services/storage/), and solution specific management consoles. The preconfigured solutions contain proven, production-ready code that you can customize and extend to implement your own specific IoT scenarios.

You may also be interested in the [Azure IoT Hub](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/services/iot-hub/) service that many of the preconfigured solutions use. [Azure IoT Hub](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/services/iot-hub/) provides the secure and reliable bi-directional communications between devices and the cloud used in the preconfigured solution architecture.
