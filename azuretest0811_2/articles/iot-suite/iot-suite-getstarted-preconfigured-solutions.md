# Tutorial: Get started with the preconfigured solutions
## Introduction
Azure IoT Suite [preconfigured solutions](iot-suite-what-are-preconfigured-solutions.md) combine multiple Azure IoT services to deliver end-to-end solutions that implement common IoT business scenarios. The *remote monitoring* preconfigured solution connects to and monitors your devices. This enables you to analyze the stream of data from your devices and to improve business outcomes by making processes respond automatically to that stream of data.

This tutorial shows you how to provision the remote monitoring preconfigured solution. It also walks you through the basic features of the remote monitoring preconfigured solution. You can access many of these features through the solution dashboard that deploys along with the preconfigured solution:

In order to complete this tutorial, you’ll need an active Azure subscription.

> [!NOTE]
> If you don’t have an account, you can create a free trial account in just a couple of minutes. For details, see [Azure Free Trial](http://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).
>

[!INCLUDE [iot-suite-provision-remote-monitoring](../../includes/iot-suite-provision-remote-monitoring.md)]

## View the solution dashboard
The solution dashboard enables you to manage the deployed solution. For example, you can view telemetry, add devices, and configure rules.

1. When the provisioning is complete and the tile for your preconfigured solution indicates **Ready**, click **Launch** to open your remote monitoring solution portal in a new tab.
   
   ![Launch the preconfigured solution](media/iot-suite-getstarted-preconfigured-solutions/launch.png)
2. By default, the solution portal shows the *solution dashboard*. You can select other views using the left-hand menu.
   
   ![Remote monitoring preconfigured solution dashboard](media/iot-suite-getstarted-preconfigured-solutions/dashboard.png)

The dashboard displays the following information:

* The map displays the location of each device connected to the solution. When you first run the solution, there are four simulated devices. The simulated devices are implemented as Azure WebJobs, and the solution uses the Bing Maps API to plot information on the map.
* The **Telemetry History** panel plots humidity and temperature telemetry from a selected device in near real time and displays aggregate data such as maximum, minimum, and average humidity.
* The **Alarm History** panel shows recent alarm events when a telemetry value has exceeded a threshold. You can define your own alarms in addition to the examples created by the preconfigured solution.

## View the device list
The device list shows all the registered devices in the solution. You view and edit device metadata, add or remove devices, and send commands to devices.

1. Click **Devices** in the left-hand menu to show the *device list* for this solution.
   
   ![Device list in dashboard](media/iot-suite-getstarted-preconfigured-solutions/devicelist.png)
2. The device list shows that there are four simulated devices created by the provisioning process.
3. Click on a device in the device list to view the device details.
   
   ![Device details in dashboard](media/iot-suite-getstarted-preconfigured-solutions/devicedetails.png)

The **Device Details** panel contains three sections:

* The **Actions** section lists the actions you can perform on the device. If you disable the device it will no longer be allowed to send telemetry or receive commands. If you disable a device, you can then enable it again. You can add a rule associated with the device that triggers an alarm when a telemetry value exceeds a threshold. You can also send a command to a device. When a device first connects it tells the solution the commands it can respond to.
* The **Device Properties** section lists the device metadata. Some of this metadata comes from the device itself (such as the manufacturer) and some is generated by the solution (such as the created time). You can edit the device metadata from here.
* The **Authentication Keys** section lists the keys the device can use to authenticate with the solution.

## Send a command to a device
The device details pane shows all of the commands that a specific device supports and enables you to send commands to a device. When a device first starts, it sends information about the commands it supports to the solution.

1. Click **Commands** in the device details pane for the selected device.
   
   ![Device commands in dashboard](media/iot-suite-getstarted-preconfigured-solutions/devicecommands.png)
2. Select **PingDevice** from the command list.
3. Click **Send Command**.
4. You can see the status of the command in the command history.
   
   ![Command status in dashboard](media/iot-suite-getstarted-preconfigured-solutions/pingcommand.png)

The solution tracks the status of each command it sends. Initially the result is **Pending**. When the device reports that it has executed the command, the result is set to **Success**.

## Add a new simulated device
When you deploy the preconfigured solution, you automatically provision the four sample devices you can see in the device list. These devices are *simulated devices* running in an Azure WebJob. Simulated devices make it easy for you to experiment with the preconfigured solution without the need to deploy real, physical devices. If you do want to connect a real device to the solution see the [Connect your device to the remote monitoring preconfigured solution](iot-suite-connecting-devices.md) tutorial.

The following steps show you how to add a new simulated device to the solution:

1. Navigate back to the device list.
2. Click **+ Add A Device** in the bottom left corner to add a new device.
   
   ![Add a device to the preconfigured solution](media/iot-suite-getstarted-preconfigured-solutions/adddevice.png)
3. Click **Add New** on the **Simulated Device** tile.
   
   ![Set new device details in dashboard](media/iot-suite-getstarted-preconfigured-solutions/addnew.png)
   
   In addition to creating a new simulated device, you can also add a physical device if you choose to create a **Custom Device**. To learn more about this, see [Connect your device to the IoT Suite remote monitoring preconfigured solution](iot-suite-connecting-devices.md).
4. Select **Let me define my own Device ID**, and enter a unique device ID name such as **mydevice_01**.
5. Click **Create**.
   
   ![Save a new device](media/iot-suite-getstarted-preconfigured-solutions/definedevice.png)
6. In step 3 of **Add a simulated device** click **Done** to return to the device list.
7. You can view your device **Running** in the device list.
   
    ![View new device in device list](media/iot-suite-getstarted-preconfigured-solutions/runningnew.png)
8. You can also view the simulated telemetry from your new device on the dashboard:
   
    ![View telemetry from new device](media/iot-suite-getstarted-preconfigured-solutions/runningnew2.png)

## Edit the device metadata
When are device first connects to the solution, it sends its metadata to the solution. When you edit the device metadata through the solution dashboard, it sends the new metadata values to the device and stores the new values in the solution DocumentDB database. For more information, see [Device identity registry and DocumentDB](iot-suite-what-are-preconfigured-solutions.md#device-identity-registry-and-documentdb).

1. Navigate back to the device list.
2. Select your new device in the **Devices List**, and then click **Edit** to edit the **Device Properties**:
   
   ![Edit device metadata](media/iot-suite-getstarted-preconfigured-solutions/editdevice.png)
3. Scroll down and make a change to the latitude and longitude vales. Then click **Save changes to device registry**.
   
    ![Edit device metadata](media/iot-suite-getstarted-preconfigured-solutions/editdevice2.png)
4. Navigate back to the dashboard, the location of device has changed on the map:
   
    ![Edit device metadata](media/iot-suite-getstarted-preconfigured-solutions/editdevice3.png)

## Add a rule for the new device
There are no rules for the new device you just added. In this section you'll add a rule that triggers an alarm when the temperature reported by the new device exceeds 47 degrees. Before you start, notice that the telemetry history for the new device on the dashboard shows the device temperature never exceeds 45 degrees.

1. Navigate back to the device list.
2. Select your new device in the **Devices List**, and then click **Add rule** to add a new rule for the device.
3. Create a rule that uses **Temperature** as the data field and uses **AlarmTemp** as the output when the temperature exceeds 47 degrees:
   
    ![Add a device rule](media/iot-suite-getstarted-preconfigured-solutions/addrule.png)
4. Click **Save and View Rules** to save your changes.
5. Click **Commands** in the device details pane for the new device.
   
   ![Add a device rule](media/iot-suite-getstarted-preconfigured-solutions/addrule2.png)
6. Select **ChangeSetPointTemp** from the command list and set **SetPointTemp** to 45. Then click **Send Command**:
   
   ![Add a device rule](media/iot-suite-getstarted-preconfigured-solutions/addrule3.png)
7. Navigate back to the solution dashboard. After a short time, you will see a new entry in the **Alarm History** pane when the temperature reported by your new device exceeds the 47 degree threshold:
   
   ![Add a device rule](media/iot-suite-getstarted-preconfigured-solutions/addrule4.png)
8. You can review and edit all your rules on the **Rules** page of the dashboard:
   
    ![List device rules](media/iot-suite-getstarted-preconfigured-solutions/rules.png)
9. You can review and edit all the actions that can be taken in response to a rule on the **Actions** page of the dashboard:
   
    ![List device actions](media/iot-suite-getstarted-preconfigured-solutions/actions.png)

> [!NOTE]
> It is possible to define actions that can send an email message or SMS in response to a rule or integrate with a line-of-business system through a [Logic App](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/services/app-service/logic/). For more information, see the [Connect Logic App to your Azure IoT Suite Remote Monitoring preconfigured solution](iot-suite-logic-apps-tutorial.md).

## Other features
Using the solution portal you can search for devices with specific characteristics such as a model number:

![Search for a device](media/iot-suite-getstarted-preconfigured-solutions/solutionportal_07.png)

You can disable a device, and after it is disabled you can remove it:

![Disable and remove a device](media/iot-suite-getstarted-preconfigured-solutions/solutionportal_08.png)

## Behind the scenes
When you deploy a preconfigured solution, the deployment process creates multiple resources in the Azure subscription you selected. You can view these resources in the Azure [portal](http://portal.azure.com/). The deployment process creates a **resource group** with a name based on the name you chose for your preconfigured solution:

![Preconfigured solution in the Azure portal](media/iot-suite-getstarted-preconfigured-solutions/portal.png)

You can view the settings of each resource by selecting it in the list of resources in the resource group. The screenshot above shows the settings for the IoT hub used in the preconfigured solution.

You can also view the source code for the preconfigured solution. The remote monitoring preconfigured solution source code is in the [azure-iot-remote-monitoring](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-remote-monitoring) GitHub repository:

* The **DeviceAdministration** folder contains the source code for the dashboard.
* The **Simulator** folder contains the source code for the simulated device.
* The **EventProcessor** folder contains the source code for the back-end process that handles the incoming telemetry.

When you are done, you can delete the preconfigured solution from your Azure subscription on the [azureiotsuite.com](https://www.azureiotsuite.com) site - this enables you to easily delete all the resources that were provisioned when you created the preconfigured solution.

> [!NOTE]
> To ensure that you delete everything related to the preconfigured solution, delete it on the [azureiotsuite.com](https://www.azureiotsuite.com) site and do not simply delete the resource group in the portal.
