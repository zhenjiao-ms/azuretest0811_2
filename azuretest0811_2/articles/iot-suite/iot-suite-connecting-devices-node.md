# Connect your device to the remote monitoring preconfigured solution (Node.js)
[!INCLUDE [iot-suite-selector-connecting](../../includes/iot-suite-selector-connecting.md)]

## Build and run the node.js sample solution
1. To clone the *Microsoft Azure IoT SDKs* GitHub repository and install the *Microsoft Azure IoT device SDK for Node.js* in your desktop environment, follow the [Prepare your development environment](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks/blob/master/doc/get_started/node-devbox-setup.md) instructions.
2. From your local copy of the [azure-iot-sdks](https://github.com/azure/azure-iot-sdks) repository, copy the following two files from the node/device/samples folder to a folder on your device:
   
   * packages.json
   * remote_monitoring.js
3. Open the remote_monitoring.js file and look for the following variable:
   
    ```
    var connectionString = "[IoT Hub device connection string]";
    ```
4. Replace **[IoT Hub device connection string]** with your device connection string. You can find the values for your IoT Hub hostname, device id, and device key in the remote monitoring solution dashboard. A device connection string has the following format:
   
    ```
    HostName={your IoT Hub hostname};DeviceId={your device id};SharedAccessKey={your device key}
    ```
   
    If your IoT Hub hostname is **contoso** and your device id is **mydevice**, your connection string will look like this:
   
    ```
    var connectionString = "HostName=contoso.azure-devices.net;DeviceId=mydevice;SharedAccessKey=2s ... =="
    ```
5. Save the file. Run the following commands at a command prompt in the folder that contains these files to install the necessary packages and then run the sample application:
   
    ```
    npm install
    node remote_monitoring.js
    ```
