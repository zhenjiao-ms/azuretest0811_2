If you've received an error when deploying resources to Azure, you may want to see more details about the deployment operations that were executed. Azure CLI provides commands that enable you to find the errors and determine potential fixes.

[!INCLUDE [resource-manager-troubleshoot-introduction](../includes/resource-manager-troubleshoot-introduction.md)]

You can avoid some errors by validating your template and infrastructure prior to deployment. You can also log additional request and response information during deployment that may be helpful later for troubleshooting. To learn about validating, and logging request and response information, see [Deploy a resource group with Azure Resource Manager template](resource-group-template-deploy-cli.md).

## Use audit logs to troubleshoot
[!INCLUDE [resource-manager-audit-limitations](../includes/resource-manager-audit-limitations.md)]

To see errors for a deployment, use the following steps:

1. To see the audit logs, run the **azure group log show** command. You can include the **--last-deployment** option to retrieve only the log for the most recent deployment.
   
        azure group log show ExampleGroup --last-deployment
2. The **azure group log show** command can return a lot of information. For troubleshooting, you usually want to focus on operations that failed. The following script uses the **--json** option and the [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) JSON utility to search the log for deployment failures.
   
        azure group log show ExampleGroup --json | jq '.[] | select(.status.value == "Failed")'
   
        {
        "claims": {
          "aud": "https://management.core.windows.net/",
          "iss": "https://sts.windows.net/<guid>/",
          "iat": "1442510510",
          "nbf": "1442510510",
          "exp": "1442514410",
          "ver": "1.0",
          "http://schemas.microsoft.com/identity/claims/tenantid": "{guid}",
          "http://schemas.microsoft.com/identity/claims/objectidentifier": "{guid}",
          "http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/emailaddress": "someone@example.com",
          "puid": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
          "http://schemas.microsoft.com/identity/claims/identityprovider": "example.com",
          "altsecid": "1:example.com:XXXXXXXXXXX",
          "http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/nameidentifier": "<hash string="">",
          "http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/givenname": "Tom",

          "wids": "{guid}",
          "appid": "{guid}",
          "appidacr": "0",
          "http://schemas.microsoft.com/identity/claims/scope": "user_impersonation",
          "http://schemas.microsoft.com/claims/authnclassreference": "1",
          "ipaddr": "000.000.000.000"
        },
        "properties": {
          "statusCode": "Conflict",
          "statusMessage": "{\"Code\":\"Conflict\",\"Message\":\"Website with given name mysite already exists.\",\"Target\":null,\"Details\":[{\"Message\":\"Website with given name
            mysite already exists.\"},{\"Code\":\"Conflict\"},{\"ErrorEntity\":{\"Code\":\"Conflict\",\"Message\":\"Website with given name mysite already exists.\",\"ExtendedCode\":
            \"54001\",\"MessageTemplate\":\"Website with given name {0} already exists.\",\"Parameters\":[\"mysite\"],\"InnerErrors\":null}}],\"Innererror\":null}"
        },
        ...
   
    You can see **properties** includes information in json about the failed operation.
   
    You can use the **--verbose** and **-vv** options to see more information from the logs.  Use the **--verbose** option to display the steps the operations go through on `stdout`. For a complete request history, use the **-vv** option. The messages often provide vital clues about the cause of any failures.
3. To focus on the status message for failed entries, use the following command:
   
        azure group log show ExampleGroup --json | jq -r ".[] | select(.status.value == \"Failed\") | .properties.statusMessage"

## Use deployment operations to troubleshoot
1. Get the overall status of a deployment with the **azure group deployment show** command. In the example below the deployment has failed.
   
        azure group deployment show --resource-group ExampleGroup --name ExampleDeployment
   
        info:    Executing command group deployment show
        + Getting deployments
        data:    DeploymentName     : ExampleDeployment
        data:    ResourceGroupName  : ExampleGroup
        data:    ProvisioningState  : Failed
        data:    Timestamp          : 2015-08-27T20:03:34.9178576Z
        data:    Mode               : Incremental
        data:    Name             Type    Value
        data:    ---------------  ------  ------------
        data:    siteName         String  ExampleSite
        data:    hostingPlanName  String  ExamplePlan
        data:    siteLocation     String  West US
        data:    sku              String  Free
        data:    workerSize       String  0
        info:    group deployment show command OK
2. To see the message for failed operations for a deployment, use:
   
        azure group deployment operation list --resource-group ExampleGroup --name ExampleDeployment --json  | jq ".[] | select(.properties.provisioningState == \"Failed\") | .properties.statusMessage.Message"
