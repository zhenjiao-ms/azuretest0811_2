# Release notes for Data Management Gateway
One of the challenges for modern data integration is to seamlessly move data to and from on-premises to cloud. Data factory makes this integration seamless with Data Management Gateway, which is an agent that you can install on-premises to enable hybrid data movement.

Please refer to [Move data between on-premises and cloud using Azure Data Factory](data-factory-move-data-between-onprem-and-cloud.md) and [Data Management Gateway](data-factory-data-management-gateway.md) articles for more information.

## CURRENT VERSION (2.1.6040.1)
* DB2 driver is included in the gateway installation package now. You do not need to install it separately. 
* DB2 driver now supports z/OS and DB2 for i (AS/400) along with the platforms already supported (Linux, Unix, and Windows). 
* Supports using DocumentDB as a source or destination for on-premises data stores
* Supports copying data from/to cold/hot blob storage along with the already supported general-purpose storage account. 
* Allows you to connect to on-premises SQL Server via gateway with remote login privileges.  

## Earlier versions
## 2.0.6013.1
* You can select the language/culture to be used by a gateway during manual installation.
* When gateway does not work as expected, you can choose to send gateway logs of last 7 days to Microsoft to facilitate troubleshooting of the issue. If gateway is not connected to the cloud service, you can choose to save and archive gateway logs.  
* User interface improvements for gateway configuration manager:
  * Make gateway status more visible on the Home tab.
  * Reorganized and simplified controls.
* You can copy data from a storage other than Azure Blob into Azure SQL Data Warehouse via Polybase & staging blob using the [code-free copy preview tool](data-factory-copy-data-wizard-tutorial.md). See [Staged Copy](data-factory-copy-activity-performance.md#staged-copy) for details about this feature in general. 
* You can leverage Data Management Gateway to ingress data directly from an on-premises SQL Server database into Azure Machine Learning.
* Performance improvements
  * Improve performance on viewing Schema/Preview against SQL Server in code-free copy preview tool.

## Questions/answers
### Why is the Data Source Manager trying to connect to a gateway?
This is a security design where you can only configure on-premises data sources for cloud access within your corporate network, and your credentials will not flow outside of your corporate firewall. Ensure your computer can reach the machine where the gateway is installed.
