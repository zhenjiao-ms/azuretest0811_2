# Move data to and from SQL Server on-premises or on IaaS (Azure VM) using Azure Data Factory
This article outlines how you can use the Copy Activity in an Azure data factory to move data to SQL Server from another data store and move data from another data store to SQL Server. This article builds on the [data movement activities](data-factory-data-movement-activities.md) article which presents a general overview of data movement with copy activity and supported data store combinations.

## Enabling connectivity
The concepts and steps needed for connecting with SQL Server hosted on-premises or in Azure IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service) VMs are the same. In both cases, you need to leverage Data Management Gateway for connectivity.

See [moving data between on-premises locations and cloud](data-factory-move-data-between-onprem-and-cloud.md) article to learn about Data Management Gateway and step-by-step instructions on setting up the gateway. Setting up a gateway instance is a pre-requisite for connecting with SQL Server.

While you can install the gateway on the same on-premises machine or cloud VM instance as the SQL Server for better performance it is recommended to install them on separate machines or cloud VM to avoid resource contention.

The following sample(s) show how to copy data to and from SQL Server and Azure Blob Storage. However, data can be copied **directly** from any of sources to any of the sinks stated [here](data-factory-data-movement-activities.md#supported-data-stores) using the Copy Activity in Azure Data Factory.  

## Sample: Copy data from SQL Server to Azure Blob
The sample below shows:

1. A linked service of type [OnPremisesSqlServer](data-factory-sqlserver-connector.md#sql-server-linked-service-properties).
2. A linked service of type [AzureStorage](data-factory-azure-blob-connector.md#azure-storage-linked-service-properties).
3. An input [dataset](data-factory-create-datasets.md) of type [SqlServerTable](data-factory-sqlserver-connector.md#sql-server-dataset-type-properties).
4. An output [dataset](data-factory-create-datasets.md) of type [AzureBlob](data-factory-azure-blob-connector.md#azure-blob-dataset-type-properties).
5. The [pipeline](data-factory-create-pipelines.md) with Copy activity that uses [SqlSource](data-factory-sqlserver-connector.md#sql-server-copy-activity-type-properties) and [BlobSink](data-factory-azure-blob-connector.md#azure-blob-copy-activity-type-properties).

The sample copies data belonging to a time series from a table in SQL Server database to a blob every hour. The JSON properties used in these samples are described in sections following the samples.

As a first step, please setup the data management gateway as per the instructions in the [moving data between on-premises locations and cloud](data-factory-move-data-between-onprem-and-cloud.md) article.

**SQL Server linked service**

    {
      "Name": "SqlServerLinkedService",
      "properties": {
        "type": "OnPremisesSqlServer",
        "typeProperties": {
          "connectionString": "Data Source=<servername>;Initial Catalog=<databasename>;Integrated Security=False;User ID=<username>;Password=<password>;",
          "gatewayName": "<gatewayname>"
        }
      }
    }

**Azure Blob storage linked service**

    {
      "name": "StorageLinkedService",
      "properties": {
        "type": "AzureStorage",
        "typeProperties": {
          "connectionString": "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=<accountname>;AccountKey=<accountkey>"
        }
      }
    }

**SQL Server input dataset**

The sample assumes you have created a table “MyTable” in SQL Server and it contains a column called “timestampcolumn” for time series data. Note that you can query over multiple tables within the same database using a single dataset, but a single table must be used for the dataset's tableName typeProperty.

Setting “external”: ”true” and specifying externalData policy information the Azure Data Factory service that this is a table that is external to the data factory and not produced by an activity in the data factory.

    {
      "name": "SqlServerInput",
      "properties": {
        "type": "SqlServerTable",
        "linkedServiceName": "SqlServerLinkedService",
        "typeProperties": {
          "tableName": "MyTable"
        },
        "external": true,
        "availability": {
          "frequency": "Hour",
          "interval": 1
        },
        "policy": {
          "externalData": {
            "retryInterval": "00:01:00",
            "retryTimeout": "00:10:00",
            "maximumRetry": 3
          }
        }
      }
    }

**Azure Blob output dataset**

Data is written to a new blob every hour (frequency: hour, interval: 1). The folder path for the blob is dynamically evaluated based on the start time of the slice that is being processed. The folder path uses year, month, day, and hours parts of the start time.

    {
      "name": "AzureBlobOutput",
      "properties": {
        "type": "AzureBlob",
        "linkedServiceName": "StorageLinkedService",
        "typeProperties": {
          "folderPath": "mycontainer/myfolder/yearno={Year}/monthno={Month}/dayno={Day}/hourno={Hour}",
          "partitionedBy": [
            {
              "name": "Year",
              "value": {
                "type": "DateTime",
                "date": "SliceStart",
                "format": "yyyy"
              }
            },
            {
              "name": "Month",
              "value": {
                "type": "DateTime",
                "date": "SliceStart",
                "format": "MM"
              }
            },
            {
              "name": "Day",
              "value": {
                "type": "DateTime",
                "date": "SliceStart",
                "format": "dd"
              }
            },
            {
              "name": "Hour",
              "value": {
                "type": "DateTime",
                "date": "SliceStart",
                "format": "HH"
              }
            }
          ],
          "format": {
            "type": "TextFormat",
            "columnDelimiter": "\t",
            "rowDelimiter": "\n"
          }
        },
        "availability": {
          "frequency": "Hour",
          "interval": 1
        }
      }
    }

**Pipeline with Copy activity**

The pipeline contains a Copy Activity that is configured to use the above input and output datasets and is scheduled to run every hour. In the pipeline JSON definition, the **source** type is set to **SqlSource** and **sink** type is set to **BlobSink**. The SQL query specified for the **SqlReaderQuery** property selects the data in the past hour to copy.

    {  
        "name":"SamplePipeline",
        "properties":{  
        "start":"2014-06-01T18:00:00",
        "end":"2014-06-01T19:00:00",
        "description":"pipeline for copy activity",
        "activities":[  
          {
            "name": "SqlServertoBlob",
            "description": "copy activity",
            "type": "Copy",
            "inputs": [
              {
                "name": " SqlServerInput"
              }
            ],
            "outputs": [
              {
                "name": "AzureBlobOutput"
              }
            ],
            "typeProperties": {
              "source": {
                "type": "SqlSource",
                "SqlReaderQuery": "$$Text.Format('select * from MyTable where timestampcolumn >= \\'{0:yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm}\\' AND timestampcolumn < \\'{1:yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm}\\'', WindowStart, WindowEnd)"
              },
              "sink": {
                "type": "BlobSink"
              }
            },
           "scheduler": {
              "frequency": "Hour",
              "interval": 1
            },
            "policy": {
              "concurrency": 1,
              "executionPriorityOrder": "OldestFirst",
              "retry": 0,
              "timeout": "01:00:00"
            }
          }
         ]
       }
    }


In the above example, **sqlReaderQuery** is specified for the SqlSource. The Copy Activity runs this query against the SQL Server Database source to get the data. Alternatively, you can specify a stored procedure by specifying the **sqlReaderStoredProcedureName** and **storedProcedureParameters** (if the stored procedure takes parameters). Note that sqlReaderQuery can reference multiple tables within the database referenced by the input dataset; it is not limited to only the table set as the dataset's tableName typeProperty.

If you do not specify either sqlReaderQuery or sqlReaderStoredProcedureName, the columns defined in the structure section of the dataset JSON are used to build a query (select column1, column2 from mytable) to run against the SQL Server Database. If the dataset definition does not have the structure, all columns are selected from the table.

See the [Sql Source](#sqlsource) section and [BlobSink](data-factory-azure-blob-connector.md#azure-blob-copy-activity-type-properties) for the list of properties supported by SqlSource and BlobSink.

## Sample: Copy data from Azure Blob to SQL Server
The sample below shows:

1. The linked service of type [OnPremisesSqlServer](data-factory-sqlserver-connector.md#sql-server-linked-service-properties).
2. The linked service of type [AzureStorage](data-factory-azure-blob-connector.md#azure-storage-linked-service-properties).
3. An input [dataset](data-factory-create-datasets.md) of type [AzureBlob](data-factory-azure-blob-connector.md#azure-blob-dataset-type-properties).
4. An output [dataset](data-factory-create-datasets.md) of type [SqlServerTable](data-factory-sqlserver-connector.md#sql-server-dataset-type-properties).
5. The [pipeline](data-factory-create-pipelines.md) with Copy activity that uses [BlobSource](data-factory-azure-blob-connector.md#azure-blob-copy-activity-type-properties) and [SqlSink](data-factory-sqlserver-connector.md#sql-server-copy-activity-type-properties).

The sample copies data belonging to a time series from Azure blob to a table in SQL Server database every hour. The JSON properties used in these samples are described in sections following the samples.

**SQL Server linked service**

    {
      "Name": "SqlServerLinkedService",
      "properties": {
        "type": "OnPremisesSqlServer",
        "typeProperties": {
          "connectionString": "Data Source=<servername>;Initial Catalog=<databasename>;Integrated Security=False;User ID=<username>;Password=<password>;",
          "gatewayName": "<gatewayname>"
        }
      }
    }

**Azure Blob storage linked service**

    {
      "name": "StorageLinkedService",
      "properties": {
        "type": "AzureStorage",
        "typeProperties": {
          "connectionString": "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=<accountname>;AccountKey=<accountkey>"
        }
      }
    }

**Azure Blob input dataset**

Data is picked up from a new blob every hour (frequency: hour, interval: 1). The folder path and file name for the blob are dynamically evaluated based on the start time of the slice that is being processed. The folder path uses year, month, and day part of the start time and file name uses the hour part of the start time. “external”: “true” setting informs the Data Factory service that this table is external to the data factory and not produced by an activity in the data factory.

    {
      "name": "AzureBlobInput",
      "properties": {
        "type": "AzureBlob",
        "linkedServiceName": "StorageLinkedService",
        "typeProperties": {
          "folderPath": "mycontainer/myfolder/yearno={Year}/monthno={Month}/dayno={Day}",
          "fileName": "{Hour}.csv",
          "partitionedBy": [
            {
              "name": "Year",
              "value": {
                "type": "DateTime",
                "date": "SliceStart",
                "format": "yyyy"
              }
            },
            {
              "name": "Month",
              "value": {
                "type": "DateTime",
                "date": "SliceStart",
                "format": "MM"
              }
            },
            {
              "name": "Day",
              "value": {
                "type": "DateTime",
                "date": "SliceStart",
                "format": "dd"
              }
            },
            {
              "name": "Hour",
              "value": {
                "type": "DateTime",
                "date": "SliceStart",
                "format": "HH"
              }
            }
          ],
          "format": {
            "type": "TextFormat",
            "columnDelimiter": ",",
            "rowDelimiter": "\n"
          }
        },
        "external": true,
        "availability": {
          "frequency": "Hour",
          "interval": 1
        },
        "policy": {
          "externalData": {
            "retryInterval": "00:01:00",
            "retryTimeout": "00:10:00",
            "maximumRetry": 3
          }
        }
      }
    }

**SQL Server output dataset**

The sample copies data to a table named “MyTable” in SQL Server. You should create the table in SQL Server with the same number of columns as you expect the Blob CSV file to contain. New rows are added to the table every hour.

    {
      "name": "SqlServerOutput",
      "properties": {
        "type": "SqlServerTable",
        "linkedServiceName": "SqlServerLinkedService",
        "typeProperties": {
          "tableName": "MyOutputTable"
        },
        "availability": {
          "frequency": "Hour",
          "interval": 1
        }
      }
    }

**Pipeline with Copy activity**

The pipeline contains a Copy Activity that is configured to use the above input and output datasets and is scheduled to run every hour. In the pipeline JSON definition, the **source** type is set to **BlobSource** and **sink** type is set to **SqlSink**.

    {  
        "name":"SamplePipeline",
        "properties":{  
        "start":"2014-06-01T18:00:00",
        "end":"2014-06-01T19:00:00",
        "description":"pipeline with copy activity",
        "activities":[  
          {
            "name": "AzureBlobtoSQL",
            "description": "Copy Activity",
            "type": "Copy",
            "inputs": [
              {
                "name": "AzureBlobInput"
              }
            ],
            "outputs": [
              {
                "name": " SqlServerOutput "
              }
            ],
            "typeProperties": {
              "source": {
                "type": "BlobSource",
                "blobColumnSeparators": ","
              },
              "sink": {
                "type": "SqlSink"
              }
            },
           "scheduler": {
              "frequency": "Hour",
              "interval": 1
            },
            "policy": {
              "concurrency": 1,
              "executionPriorityOrder": "OldestFirst",
              "retry": 0,
              "timeout": "01:00:00"
            }
          }
          ]
       }
    }

## SQL Server linked service properties
The following table provides description for JSON elements specific to SQL Server linked service.

| Property | Description | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| type |The type property should be set to: **OnPremisesSqlServer**. |Yes |
| connectionString |Specify connectionString information needed to connect to the on-premises SQL Server database using either SQL authentication or Windows authentication. |Yes |
| gatewayName |Name of the gateway that the Data Factory service should use to connect to the on-premises SQL Server database. |Yes |
| username |Specify user name if you are using Windows Authentication. Example: **domainname\\username**. |No |
| password |Specify password for the user account you specified for the username. |No |

You can encrypt credentials using the **New-AzureRmDataFactoryEncryptValue** cmdlet and use them in the connection string as shown in the following example (**EncryptedCredential** property):  

    "connectionString": "Data Source=<servername>;Initial Catalog=<databasename>;Integrated Security=True;EncryptedCredential=<encrypted credential>",

### Samples
**JSON for using SQL Authentication**

    {
        "name": "MyOnPremisesSQLDB",
        "properties":
        {
            "type": "OnPremisesSqlLinkedService",
            "typeProperties": {
                "connectionString": "Data Source=<servername>;Initial Catalog=MarketingCampaigns;Integrated Security=False;User ID=<username>;Password=<password>;",
                "gatewayName": "<gateway name>"
            }
        }
    }

**JSON for using Windows Authentication**

If username and password are specified, gateway will use them to impersonate the specified user account to connect to the on-premises SQL Server database. Otherwise, gateway will connect to the SQL Server directly with the security context of Gateway (its startup account).

    {
         "Name": " MyOnPremisesSQLDB",
         "Properties":
         {
             "type": "OnPremisesSqlLinkedService",
             "typeProperties": {
                 "ConnectionString": "Data Source=<servername>;Initial Catalog=MarketingCampaigns;Integrated Security=True;",
                 "username": "<domain\\username>",
                 "password": "<password>",
                 "gatewayName": "<gateway name>"
            }
         }
    }

See [Setting Credentials and Security](data-factory-move-data-between-onprem-and-cloud.md#set-credentials-and-security) for details about setting credentials for an SQL Server data source.

## SQL Server dataset type properties
For a full list of sections & properties available for defining datasets, see the [Creating datasets](data-factory-create-datasets.md) article. Sections like structure, availability, and policy of a dataset JSON are similar for all dataset types (SQL Server, Azure blob, Azure table, etc...).

The typeProperties section is different for each type of dataset and provides information about the location of the data in the data store. The **typeProperties** section for the dataset of type **SqlServerTable** has the following properties.

| Property | Description | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| tableName |Name of the table in the SQL Server Database instance that linked service refers to. |Yes |

## SQL Server copy activity type properties
For a full list of sections & properties available for defining activities, see the [Creating Pipelines](data-factory-create-pipelines.md) article. Properties like name, description, input and output tables, various policies etc are available for all types of activities.

> [!NOTE]
> The Copy Activity takes only one input and produces only one output.
> 
> 

Properties available in the typeProperties section of the activity on the other hand vary with each activity type and in case of Copy activity they vary depending on the types of sources and sinks.

### SqlSource
In case of Copy activity when source is of type **SqlSource** the following properties are available in **typeProperties** section:

| Property | Description | Allowed values | Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| sqlReaderQuery |Use the custom query to read data. |SQL query string.For example: select * from MyTable. May reference multiple tables from the database referenced by the input dataset. If not specified, the SQL statement that is executed: select from MyTable. |No |
| sqlReaderStoredProcedureName |Name of the stored procedure that reads data from the source table. |Name of the stored procedure. |No |
| storedProcedureParameters |Parameters for the stored procedure. |Name/value pairs. Names and casing of parameters must match the names and casing of the stored procedure parameters. |No |

If the **sqlReaderQuery** is specified for the SqlSource, the Copy Activity runs this query against the SQL Server Database source to get the data.

Alternatively, you can specify a stored procedure by specifying the **sqlReaderStoredProcedureName** and **storedProcedureParameters** (if the stored procedure takes parameters).

If you do not specify either sqlReaderQuery or sqlReaderStoredProcedureName, the columns defined in the structure section of the dataset JSON are used to build a query (select column1, column2 from mytable) to run against the SQL Server Database. If the dataset definition does not have the structure, all columns are selected from the table.

> [!NOTE]
> When you use **sqlReaderStoredProcedureName**, you still need to specify a value for the **tableName** property in the dataset JSON. This is a limitation with the product at this time. There are no validations performed against this table though.
> 
> 

### SqlSink
**SqlSink** supports the following properties:

| Property | Description | Allowed values | Required |

## Troubleshooting connection issues
1. Configure your SQL Server to accept remote connections. Launch **SQL Server Management Studio**, right-click **server**, and click **Properties**. Select **Connections** from the list and check **Allow remote connections to the server**.
   
    ![Enable remote connections](.\\media\\data-factory-sqlserver-connector\\AllowRemoteConnections.png)
   
    See [Configure the remote access Server Configuration Option](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms191464.aspx) for detailed steps.
2. Launch **SQL Server Configuration Manager**. Expand **SQL Server Network Configuration** for the instance you want, and select **Protocols for MSSQLSERVER**. You should see protocols in the right-pane. Enable TCP/IP by right-clicking **TCP/IP** and clicking **Enable**.
   
    ![Enable TCP/IP](.\\media\\data-factory-sqlserver-connector\\EnableTCPProptocol.png)
   
    See [Enable or Disable a Server Network Protocol](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms191294.aspx) for details and alternate ways of enabling TCP/IP protocol.
3. In the same window, double-click **TCP/IP** to launch **TCP/IP Properties** window.
4. Switch to the **IP Addresses** tab. Scroll down to see **IPAll** section. Note down the **TCP Port **(default is **1433**).
5. Create a **rule for the Windows Firewall** on the machine to allow incoming traffic through this port.  
6. **Verify connection**: use SQL Server Management Studio from a different machine to connect to the SQL Server using fully qualified name. For example: <machine>.<domain>.corp.<company>.com,1433.

## Identity columns in the target database
This section provides an example for copying data from a source table without an identity column to a destination table with an identity column.

**Source table:**

    create table dbo.SourceTbl
    (
           name varchar(100),
           age int
    )

**Destination table:**

    create table dbo.TargetTbl
    (
           id int identity(1,1),
           name varchar(100),
           age int
    )


Notice that the target table has an identity column.

**Source dataset JSON definition**

    {
        "name": "SampleSource",
        "properties": {
            "published": false,
            "type": " SqlServerTable",
            "linkedServiceName": "TestIdentitySQL",
            "typeProperties": {
                "tableName": "SourceTbl"
            },
            "availability": {
                "frequency": "Hour",
                "interval": 1
            },
            "external": true,
            "policy": {}
        }
    }

**Destination dataset JSON definition**

    {
        "name": "SampleTarget",
        "properties": {
            "structure": [
                { "name": "name" },
                { "name": "age" }
            ],
            "published": false,
            "type": "AzureSqlTable",
            "linkedServiceName": "TestIdentitySQLSource",
            "typeProperties": {
                "tableName": "TargetTbl"
            },
            "availability": {
                "frequency": "Hour",
                "interval": 1
            },
            "external": false,
            "policy": {}
        }
    }


Notice that as your source and target table have different schema (target has an additional column with identity). In this scenario, you need to specify **structure** property in  the target dataset definition, which doesn’t include the identity column.

### Type mapping for SQL server & Azure SQL
As mentioned in the [data movement activities](data-factory-data-movement-activities.md) article, the  Copy activity performs automatic type conversions from automatic type conversions from source types to sink types with the following 2 step approach:

1. Convert from native source types to .NET type
2. Convert from .NET type to native sink type

When moving data to & from Azure SQL, SQL server, Sybase the following mappings will be used from SQL type to .NET type and vice versa.

The mapping is same as the SQL Server Data Type Mapping for ADO.NET.

| SQL Server Database Engine type | .NET Framework type |
| --- | --- |
| bigint |Int64 |
| binary |Byte[] |
| bit |Boolean |
| char |String, Char[] |
| date |DateTime |
| Datetime |DateTime |
| datetime2 |DateTime |
| Datetimeoffset |DateTimeOffset |
| Decimal |Decimal |
| FILESTREAM attribute (varbinary(max)) |Byte[] |
| Float |Double |
| image |Byte[] |
| int |Int32 |
| money |Decimal |
| nchar |String, Char[] |
| ntext |String, Char[] |
| numeric |Decimal |
| nvarchar |String, Char[] |
| real |Single |
| rowversion |Byte[] |
| smalldatetime |DateTime |
| smallint |Int16 |
| smallmoney |Decimal |
| sql_variant |Object * |
| text |String, Char[] |
| time |TimeSpan |
| timestamp |Byte[] |
| tinyint |Byte |
| uniqueidentifier |Guid |
| varbinary |Byte[] |
| varchar |String, Char[] |
| xml |Xml |
