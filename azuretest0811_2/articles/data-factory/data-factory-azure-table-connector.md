# Move data to and from Azure Table using Azure Data Factory
This article outlines how you can use the Copy Activity in an Azure data factory to move data from another data store to Azure Table and move data from Azure Table to another data store. This article builds on the [data movement activities](data-factory-data-movement-activities.md) article which presents a general overview of data movement with copy activity and supported data store combinations.

The following sample(s) show how to copy data to and from Azure Table Storage and Azure Blob Storage. However, data can be copied **directly** from any of sources to any of the sinks stated [here](data-factory-data-movement-activities.md#supported-data-stores) using the Copy Activity in Azure Data Factory.  

## Sample: Copy data from Azure Table to Azure Blob
The sample below shows:

1. A linked service of type [AzureStorage](data-factory-azure-blob-connector.md#azure-storage-linked-service-properties) (used for both table & blob).
2. An input [dataset](data-factory-create-datasets.md) of type [AzureTable](#azure-table-dataset-type-properties).
3. An output [dataset](data-factory-create-datasets.md) of type [AzureBlob](data-factory-azure-blob-connector.md#azure-blob-dataset-type-properties). 
4. The [pipeline](data-factory-create-pipelines.md) with Copy activity that uses [AzureTableSource](#azure-table-copy-activity-type-properties) and [BlobSink](data-factory-azure-blob-connector.md#azure-blob-copy-activity-type-properties). 

The sample copies data belonging to the default partition in an Azure Table to a blob every hour. The JSON properties used in these samples are described in sections following the samples.

**Azure storage linked service:**

    {
      "name": "StorageLinkedService",
      "properties": {
        "type": "AzureStorage",
        "typeProperties": {
          "connectionString": "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=<accountname>;AccountKey=<accountkey>"
        }
      }
    }

Azure Data Factory supports two types of Azure Storage linked services: **AzureStorage** and **AzureStorageSas**. For the first one, you specify the connection string that includes the account key and for the later one, you specify the Shared Access Signature (SAS) Uri.   See [Linked Services](#linked-services) section for details.  

**Azure Table input dataset:**

The sample assumes you have created a table “MyTable” in Azure Table.

Setting “external”: ”true” and specifying externalData policy tells data factory that this is a table that is external to the data factory and not produced by an activity in the data factory.

    {
      "name": "AzureTableInput",
      "properties": {
        "type": "AzureTable",
        "linkedServiceName": "StorageLinkedService",
        "typeProperties": {
          "tableName": "MyTable"
        },
        "external": true,
        "availability": {
          "frequency": "Hour",
          "interval": 1
        },
        "policy": {
          "externalData": {
            "retryInterval": "00:01:00",
            "retryTimeout": "00:10:00",
            "maximumRetry": 3
          }
        }
      }
    }

**Azure Blob output dataset:**

Data is written to a new blob every hour (frequency: hour, interval: 1). The folder path for the blob is dynamically evaluated based on the start time of the slice that is being processed. The folder path uses year, month, day, and hours parts of the start time. 

    {
      "name": "AzureBlobOutput",
      "properties": {
        "type": "AzureBlob",
        "linkedServiceName": "StorageLinkedService",
        "typeProperties": {
          "folderPath": "mycontainer/myfolder/yearno={Year}/monthno={Month}/dayno={Day}/hourno={Hour}",
          "partitionedBy": [
            {
              "name": "Year",
              "value": {
                "type": "DateTime",
                "date": "SliceStart",
                "format": "yyyy"
              }
            },
            {
              "name": "Month",
              "value": {
                "type": "DateTime",
                "date": "SliceStart",
                "format": "MM"
              }
            },
            {
              "name": "Day",
              "value": {
                "type": "DateTime",
                "date": "SliceStart",
                "format": "dd"
              }
            },
            {
              "name": "Hour",
              "value": {
                "type": "DateTime",
                "date": "SliceStart",
                "format": "HH"
              }
            }
          ],
          "format": {
            "type": "TextFormat",
            "columnDelimiter": "\t",
            "rowDelimiter": "\n"
          }
        },
        "availability": {
          "frequency": "Hour",
          "interval": 1
        }
      }
    }

**Pipeline with the Copy activity:**

The pipeline contains a Copy Activity that is configured to use the above input and output datasets and is scheduled to run every hour. In the pipeline JSON definition, the **source** type is set to **AzureTableSource** and **sink** type is set to **BlobSink**. The SQL query specified with **AzureTableSourceQuery** property selects the data from the default partition every hour to copy.

                          }
                    ],
                    "typeProperties": {
                          "source": {

                            "type": "BlobSink"
                          }

                          "frequency": "Hour",
                          "interval": 1
                    },                
                    "policy": {
                          "concurrency": 1,
                          "executionPriorityOrder": "OldestFirst",
                          "retry": 0,
                          "timeout": "01:00:00"
                    }
                }
             ]    
        }
    }

## Sample: Copy data from Azure Blob to Azure Table
The sample below shows:

1. A linked service of type [AzureStorage](data-factory-azure-blob-connector.md#azure-storage-linked-service-properties) (used for both table & blob)
2. An input [dataset](data-factory-create-datasets.md) of type [AzureBlob](data-factory-azure-blob-connector.md#azure-blob-dataset-type-properties).
3. An output [dataset](data-factory-create-datasets.md) of type [AzureTable](#azure-table-dataset-type-properties). 
4. The [pipeline](data-factory-create-pipelines.md) with Copy activity that uses [BlobSource](data-factory-azure-blob-connector.md#azure-blob-copy-activity-type-properties) and [AzureTableSink](#azure-table-copy-activity-type-properties). 

The sample copies data belonging to a time series from Azure blob to a table in Azure Table database every hour. The JSON properties used in these samples are described in sections following the samples.

**Azure storage (for both Azure Table & Blob) linked service:**

    {
      "name": "StorageLinkedService",
      "properties": {
        "type": "AzureStorage",
        "typeProperties": {
          "connectionString": "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=<accountname>;AccountKey=<accountkey>"
        }
      }
    }

Azure Data Factory supports two types of Azure Storage linked services: **AzureStorage** and **AzureStorageSas**. For the first one, you specify the connection string that includes the account key and for the later one, you specify the Shared Access Signature (SAS) Uri.   See [Linked Services](#linked-services) section for details. 

**Azure Blob input dataset:**

Data is picked up from a new blob every hour (frequency: hour, interval: 1). The folder path and file name for the blob are dynamically evaluated based on the start time of the slice that is being processed. The folder path uses year, month, and day part of the start time and file name uses the hour part of the start time. “external”: “true” setting informs the Data Factory service that this table is external to the data factory and not produced by an activity in the data factory.

                "format": "HH"
              }
            }
          ],
          "format": {
            "type": "TextFormat",
            "columnDelimiter": ",",

            "maximumRetry": 3
          }
        }
      }
    }

**Azure Table output dataset:**

The sample copies data to a table named “MyTable” in Azure Table. You should create the table in Azure Table with the same number of columns as you expect the Blob CSV file to contain. New rows are added to the table every hour. 

    {
      "name": "AzureTableOutput",
      "properties": {
        "type": "AzureTable",
        "linkedServiceName": "StorageLinkedService",
        "typeProperties": {
          "tableName": "MyOutputTable"
        },
        "availability": {
          "frequency": "Hour",
          "interval": 1
        }
      }
    }

**Pipeline with the Copy activity:**

The pipeline contains a Copy Activity that is configured to use the above input and output datasets and is scheduled to run every hour. In the pipeline JSON definition, the **source** type is set to **BlobSource** and **sink** type is set to **AzureTableSink**. 

    {  
        "name":"SamplePipeline",
        "properties":{  
        "start":"2014-06-01T18:00:00",
        "end":"2014-06-01T19:00:00",
        "description":"pipeline with copy activity",
        "activities":[  
          {
            "name": "AzureBlobtoTable",
            "description": "Copy Activity",
            "type": "Copy",
            "inputs": [
              {
                "name": "AzureBlobInput"
              }
            ],
            "outputs": [
              {
                "name": "AzureTableOutput"
              }
            ],
            "typeProperties": {
              "source": {
                "type": "BlobSource"
              },
              "sink": {
                "type": "AzureTableSink",
                "writeBatchSize": 100,
                "writeBatchTimeout": "01:00:00"
              }
            },
            "scheduler": {
              "frequency": "Hour",
              "interval": 1
            },                        
            "policy": {
              "concurrency": 1,
              "executionPriorityOrder": "OldestFirst",
              "retry": 0,
              "timeout": "01:00:00"
            }
          }
          ]
       }
    }

## Linked Services
There are two types of linked services you can use to link an Azure blob storage to an Azure data factory. They are: **AzureStorage** linked service and **AzureStorageSas** linked service. The Azure Storage linked service provides the data factory with global access to the Azure Storage. Whereas, The Azure Storage SAS (Shared Access Signature) linked service provides the data factory with restricted/time-bound access to the Azure Storage. There are no other differences between these two linked services. Choose the linked service that suits your needs. The following sections provide more details on these two linked services.

[!INCLUDE [data-factory-azure-storage-linked-services](../../includes/data-factory-azure-storage-linked-services.md)]

## Azure Table Dataset type properties
For a full list of sections & properties available for defining datasets, see the [Creating datasets](data-factory-create-datasets.md) article. Sections like structure, availability, and policy of a dataset JSON are similar for all dataset types (Azure SQL, Azure blob, Azure table, etc...).  

The typeProperties section is different for each type of dataset and provides information about the location of the data in the data store. The **typeProperties** section for the dataset of type **AzureTable** has the following properties.

| Property | Description | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| tableName |Name of the table in the Azure Table Database instance that linked service refers to. |Yes. When a tableName is specified without an azureTableSourceQuery, all records from the table are copied to the destination. If an azureTableSourceQuery is also specified, records from the table that satisfies the query are copied to the destination. |

### Schema by Data Factory
For schema-free data stores such as Azure Table, the Data Factory service infers the schema in one of the following ways:  

1. If you specify the structure of data by using the **structure** property in the dataset definition, the Data Factory service honors this structure as the schema. In this case, if a row does not contain a value for a column, a null value will be provided for it.
2. If you do not specify the structure of data by using the **structure** property in the dataset definition, the Data Factory service infers the schema by using the first row in the data. In this case, if the first row does not contain the full schema, some columns will be missing in the result of copy operation.

Therefore, for schema-free data sources, the best practice is to specify the structure of data using the **structure** property.

## Azure Table Copy Activity type properties
For a full list of sections & properties available for defining activities, see the [Creating Pipelines](data-factory-create-pipelines.md) article. Properties like name, description, input and output tables, various policies etc are available for all types of activities. 

Properties available in the typeProperties section of the activity on the other hand vary with each activity type and in case of Copy activity they vary depending on the types of sources and sinks.

**AzureTableSource** supports the following properties in typeProperties section:

| Property | Description | Allowed values | Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| azureTableSourceQuery |Use the custom query to read data. |Azure table query string. See examples below. |No. When a tableName is specified without an azureTableSourceQuery, all records from the table are copied to the destination. If an azureTableSourceQuery is also specified, records from the table that satisfies the query are copied to the destination.   |
| azureTableSourceIgnoreTableNotFound |Indicate whether swallow the exception of table not exist. |TRUE<br/>FALSE |No | |

### azureTableSourceQuery examples
If Azure Table column is of string type: 

    azureTableSourceQuery": "$$Text.Format('PartitionKey ge \\'{0:yyyyMMddHH00_0000}\\' and PartitionKey le \\'{0:yyyyMMddHH00_9999}\\'', SliceStart)"

If Azure Table column is of datetime type: 

    "azureTableSourceQuery": "$$Text.Format('DeploymentEndTime gt datetime\\'{0:yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ}\\' and DeploymentEndTime le datetime\\'{1:yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ}\\'', SliceStart, SliceEnd)"


**AzureTableSink** supports the following properties in typeProperties section:

| Property | Description | Allowed values | Required   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| azureTableDefaultPartitionKeyValue |Default partition key value that can be used by the sink. |A string value. |No  |
| azureTablePartitionKeyName |User specified column name, whose column values are used as partition key. If not specified, AzureTableDefaultPartitionKeyValue is used as the partition key. |A column name. |No | |
| azureTableRowKeyName |User specified column name, whose column values are used as row key. If not specified, use a GUID for each row. |A column name. |No   |
| azureTableInsertType |The mode to insert data into Azure table.<br/><br/>This property controls whether existing rows in the output table with matching partition and row keys will have their values replaced or merged. <br/><br/>See [Insert or Merge Entity](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/hh452241.aspx) and [Insert or Replace Entity](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/hh452242.aspx) topics to learn about how these settings (merge and replace) work. <br/><br> Please note that this setting applies at the row level, not the table level, and neither option will delete rows in the output table that do not exist in the input. |merge (default)<br/>replace |No  |
| writeBatchSize |Inserts data into the Azure table when the writeBatchSize or writeBatchTimeout is hit. |Integer (number of rows) |No (default: 10000)  |
| writeBatchTimeout |Inserts data into the Azure table when the writeBatchSize or writeBatchTimeout is hit |timespan<br/><br/>Example: “00:20:00” (20 minutes) |No (Default to storage client default timeout value 90 sec) |

### azureTablePartitionKeyName
You will need to map a source column to a destination column using the translator JSON property before you can use the destination column as the azureTablePartitionKeyName.

In the following example, source column DivisionID is mapped to the destination column: DivisionID.  

    "translator": {
        "type": "TabularTranslator",
        "columnMappings": "DivisionID: DivisionID, FirstName: FirstName, LastName: LastName"
    } 

The EmpID is specifies as the partition key. 

    "sink": {
        "type": "AzureTableSink",
        "azureTablePartitionKeyName": "DivisionID",
        "writeBatchSize": 100,
        "writeBatchTimeout": "01:00:00"
    }

### Type Mapping for Azure Table
As mentioned in the [data movement activities](data-factory-data-movement-activities.md) article, Copy activity performs automatic type conversions from automatic type conversions from source types to sink types with the following 2 step approach.

1. Convert from native source types to .NET type
2. Convert from .NET type to native sink type

When moving data to & from Azure Table, the following [mappings defined by Azure Table service](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dd179338.aspx) will be used from Azure Table OData types to .NET type and vice versa. 

| OData Data Type | .NET Type | Details |

### Type Conversion Sample
The following sample is for copying data from an Azure Blob to Azure Table with type conversions. 

Suppose the Blob dataset is in CSV format and contains 3 columns. One of them is a datetime column with a custom datetime format using abbreviated French names for day of the week. 

You will define the Blob Source dataset as follows along with type definitions for the columns.

    {
        "name": " AzureBlobInput",
        "properties":
        {
             "structure": 
              [
                    { "name": "userid", "type": "Int64"},
                    { "name": "name", "type": "String"},
                    { "name": "lastlogindate", "type": "Datetime", "culture": "fr-fr", "format": "ddd-MM-YYYY"}
              ],
            "type": "AzureBlob",
            "linkedServiceName": "StorageLinkedService",
            "typeProperties": {
                "folderPath": "mycontainer/myfolder",
                "fileName":"myfile.csv",
                "format":
                {
                    "type": "TextFormat",
                    "columnDelimiter": ","
                }
            },
            "external": true,
            "availability":
            {
                "frequency": "Hour",
                "interval": 1,
            },
            "policy": {
                "externalData": {
                    "retryInterval": "00:01:00",
                    "retryTimeout": "00:10:00",
                    "maximumRetry": 3
                }
            }
        }
    }

Given the type mapping from Azure Table OData type to .NET type above you would define the table in Azure Table with the following schema. 

**Azure Table schema:**

| Column name | Type |
| --- | --- |
| userid |Edm.Int64 |
| name |Edm.String  |
| lastlogindate |Edm.DateTime |

Next, you will define the Azure Table dataset as follows. You do not need to specify “structure” section with the type information since the type information is already specified in the underlying data store.

    {
      "name": "AzureTableOutput",
      "properties": {
        "type": "AzureTable",
        "linkedServiceName": "StorageLinkedService",
        "typeProperties": {
          "tableName": "MyOutputTable"
        },
        "availability": {
          "frequency": "Hour",
          "interval": 1
        }
      }
    }

In this case data factory will automatically do the type conversions including the Datetime field with the custom datetime format using the fr-fr culture when moving data from Blob to Azure Table.
