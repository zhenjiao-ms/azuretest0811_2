# Move data From a OData source using Azure Data Factory
This article outlines how you can use the Copy Activity in an Azure data factory to move data from an OData source to another data store. This article builds on the [data movement activities](data-factory-data-movement-activities.md) article which presents a general overview of data movement with copy activity and supported data store combinations.

> [!NOTE]
> This OData connector support copying data from both cloud OData and on-premises OData sources. For the latter, you need to install the Data Management Gateway. See [Move data between on-premises and cloud](data-factory-move-data-between-onprem-and-cloud.md) article for details about Data Management Gateway.

## Sample: Copy data from OData source to Azure Blob
This sample shows how to copy data from an OData source to Azure Blob Storage. However, data can be copied **directly** to any of the sinks stated [here](data-factory-data-movement-activities.md#supported-data-stores) using the Copy Activity in Azure Data Factory.  

The sample has the following data factory entities:

1. A linked service of type [OData](#odata-linked-service-properties).
2. A linked service of type [AzureStorage](data-factory-azure-blob-connector.md#azure-storage-linked-service-properties).
3. An input [dataset](data-factory-create-datasets.md) of type [ODataResource](#odata-dataset-type-properties).
4. An output [dataset](data-factory-create-datasets.md) of type [AzureBlob](data-factory-azure-blob-connector.md#azure-blob-dataset-type-properties).
5. A [pipeline](data-factory-create-pipelines.md) with Copy Activity that uses [RelationalSource](#odata-copy-activity-type-properties) and [BlobSink](data-factory-azure-blob-connector.md#azure-blob-copy-activity-type-properties).

The sample copies data from querying against an OData source to an Azure blob every hour. The JSON properties used in these samples are described in sections following the samples. 

**OData linked service**
This example uses the Basic authentication. See [OData linked service](#odata-linked-service-properties) section for different types of authentication you can use. 

    {
        "name": "ODataLinkedService",
           "properties": 
        {
            "type": "OData",
               "typeProperties": 
            {
                "url": "http://services.odata.org/OData/OData.svc",
               "authenticationType": "Anonymous"
               }
           }
    }


**Azure Storage linked service**

    {
          "name": "AzureStorageLinkedService",
        "properties": {
            "type": "AzureStorage",
            "typeProperties": {
              "connectionString": "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=<accountname>;AccountKey=<accountkey>"
            }
          }
    }

**OData input dataset**

Setting “external”: ”true” and specifying externalData policy informs the Data Factory service that the table is external to the data factory and not produced by an activity in the data factory.

    {
        "name": "ODataDataset",
        "properties": 
        {
            "type": "ODataResource",
            "typeProperties": 
            {
                 "path": "Products" 
            },
            "linkedServiceName": "ODataLinkedService",
            "structure": [],
            "availability": {
                "frequency": "Hour",
                "interval": 1
            },
            "external": true,
            "policy": {
                "retryInterval": "00:01:00",
                "retryTimeout": "00:10:00",
                "maximumRetry": 3                
            }
        }
    }

Note that specifying **path** in the dataset definition is optional. 

**Azure Blob output dataset**

Data is written to a new blob every hour (frequency: hour, interval: 1). The folder path for the blob is dynamically evaluated based on the start time of the slice that is being processed. The folder path uses year, month, day, and hours parts of the start time.

    {
        "name": "AzureBlobODataDataSet",
        "properties": {
            "type": "AzureBlob",
            "linkedServiceName": "AzureStorageLinkedService",
            "typeProperties": {
                "folderPath": "mycontainer/odata/yearno={Year}/monthno={Month}/dayno={Day}/hourno={Hour}",
                "format": {
                    "type": "TextFormat",
                    "rowDelimiter": "\n",
                    "columnDelimiter": "\t"
                },
                "partitionedBy": [
                    {
                        "name": "Year",
                        "value": {
                            "type": "DateTime",
                            "date": "SliceStart",
                            "format": "yyyy"
                        }
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "Month",
                        "value": {
                            "type": "DateTime",
                            "date": "SliceStart",
                            "format": "MM"
                        }
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "Day",
                        "value": {
                            "type": "DateTime",
                            "date": "SliceStart",
                            "format": "dd"
                        }
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "Hour",
                        "value": {
                            "type": "DateTime",
                            "date": "SliceStart",
                            "format": "HH"
                        }
                    }
                ]
            },
            "availability": {
                "frequency": "Hour",
                "interval": 1
            }
        }
    }



**Pipeline with Copy activity**

The pipeline contains a Copy Activity that is configured to use the above input and output datasets and is scheduled to run every hour. In the pipeline JSON definition, the **source** type is set to **RelationalSource** and **sink** type is set to **BlobSink**. The SQL query specified for the **query** property selects the latest (newest) data from the OData source.

    {
        "name": "CopyODataToBlob",
        "properties": {
            "description": "pipeline for copy activity",
            "activities": [
                {
                    "type": "Copy",
                    "typeProperties": {
                        "source": {
                            "type": "RelationalSource",
                            "query": "?$select=Name, Description&$top=5",
                        },
                        "sink": {

                            "writeBatchSize": 0,
                            "writeBatchTimeout": "00:00:00"
                        }
                    },
                    "inputs": [
                        {
                            "name": "ODataDataSet"
                        }
                    ],
                    "outputs": [
                        {
                            "name": "AzureBlobODataDataSet"
                        }
                    ],
                    "policy": {
                        "timeout": "01:00:00",
                        "concurrency": 1
                    },
                    "scheduler": {
                        "frequency": "Hour",
                        "interval": 1
                    },
                    "name": "ODataToBlob"
                }
            ],
            "start": "2016-02-01T18:00:00Z",
            "end": "2016-02-03T19:00:00Z"
        }
    }


Note that specifying **query** in the pipeline definition is optional. The **URL** that the Data Factory service uses to retrieve data is: URL specified in the linked service (required) + path specified in the dataset (optional) + query in the pipeline (optional). 

## OData linked Service properties
The following table provides description for JSON elements specific to OData linked service.

    }



## OData dataset type properties
For a full list of sections & properties available for defining datasets, see the [Creating datasets](data-factory-create-datasets.md) article. Sections like structure, availability, and policy of a dataset JSON are similar for all dataset types (Azure SQL, Azure blob, Azure table, etc...).

The **typeProperties** section is different for each type of dataset and provides information about the location of the data in the data store. The typeProperties section for dataset of type **ODataResource** (which includes OData dataset) has the following properties

| Property | Description | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| path |Path to the OData resource |No |

## OData Copy Activity type properties
For a full list of sections & properties available for defining activities, see the [Creating Pipelines](data-factory-create-pipelines.md) article. Properties like name, description, input and output tables, various policies etc. are available for all types of activities. 

Properties available in the typeProperties section of the activity on the other hand vary with each activity type and in case of Copy activity they vary depending on the types of sources and sinks.

In case of Copy Activity when source is of type **RelationalSource** (which includes OData) the following properties are available in typeProperties section:

| Property | Description | Example | Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| query |Use the custom query to read data. |"?$select=Name, Description&$top=5" |No |

[!INCLUDE [data-factory-structure-for-rectangualr-datasets](../../includes/data-factory-structure-for-rectangualr-datasets.md)]

### Type mapping for OData
As mentioned in the [data movement activities](data-factory-data-movement-activities.md) article, Copy activity performs automatic type conversions from source types to sink types with the following 2 step approach:

1. Convert from native source types to .NET type
2. Convert from .NET type to native sink type

When moving data from OData data stores, OData data types are mapped to .NET types.

[!INCLUDE [data-factory-column-mapping](../../includes/data-factory-column-mapping.md)]

[!INCLUDE [data-factory-type-repeatability-for-relational-sources](../../includes/data-factory-type-repeatability-for-relational-sources.md)]

## Performance and Tuning
See [Copy Activity Performance & Tuning Guide](data-factory-copy-activity-performance.md) to learn about key factors that impact performance of data movement (Copy Activity) in Azure Data Factory and various ways to optimize it.
