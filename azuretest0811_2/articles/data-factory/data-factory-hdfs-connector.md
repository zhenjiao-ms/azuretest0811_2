# Move data From on-premises HDFS using Azure Data Factory
This article outlines how you can use the Copy Activity in an Azure data factory to move data from an on-premises HDFS to another data store. This article builds on the [data movement activities](data-factory-data-movement-activities.md) article which presents a general overview of data movement with copy activity and supported data store combinations.

Data factory currently supports only moving data from an on-premises HDFS to other data stores, but not for moving data from other data stores to an on-premises HDFS.

## Enabling connectivity
Data Factory service supports connecting to on-premises HDFS using the Data Management Gateway. See [moving data between on-premises locations and cloud](data-factory-move-data-between-onprem-and-cloud.md) article to learn about Data Management Gateway and step-by-step instructions on setting up the gateway. You need to leverage the gateway to connect to HDFS even if it is hosted in an Azure IaaS VM. 

While you can install the gateway on the same on-premises machine or the Azure VM as the HDFS, we recommend that you install the gateway on a separate machine or a separate Azure IaaS VM to avoid resource contention and for better performance. When you install the gateway on a separate machine, the machine should be able to access the machine with the HDFS. 

## Sample: Copy data from on-premises HDFS to Azure Blob
This sample shows how to copy data from an on-premises HDFS to Azure Blob Storage. However, data can be copied **directly** to any of the sinks stated [here](data-factory-data-movement-activities.md#supported-data-stores) using the Copy Activity in Azure Data Factory.  

The sample has the following data factory entities:

1. A linked service of type [OnPremisesHdfs](#hdfs-linked-service-properties).
2. A linked service of type [AzureStorage](data-factory-azure-blob-connector.md#azure-storage-linked-service-properties).
3. An input [dataset](data-factory-create-datasets.md) of type [FileShare](#hdfs-dataset-type-properties).
4. An output [dataset](data-factory-create-datasets.md) of type [AzureBlob](data-factory-azure-blob-connector.md#azure-blob-dataset-type-properties).
5. A [pipeline](data-factory-create-pipelines.md) with Copy Activity that uses [FileSystemSource](#hdfs-copy-activity-type-properties) and [BlobSink](data-factory-azure-blob-connector.md#azure-blob-copy-activity-type-properties).

The sample copies data from a query result in an on-premises HDFS to a blob every hour. The JSON properties used in these samples are described in sections following the samples. 

As a first step, please setup the data management gateway as per the instructions in the [moving data between on-premises locations and cloud](data-factory-move-data-between-onprem-and-cloud.md) article. 

**HDFS linked service**
This example uses the Windows authentication. See [HDFS linked service](#hdfs-linked-service-properties) section for different types of authentication you can use. 

    {
        "name": "HDFSLinkedService",
        "properties":
        {
            "type": "Hdfs",
            "typeProperties":
            {
                "authenticationType": "Windows",
                "userName": "Administrator",
                "password": "password",
                "url" : "http://<machine>:50070/webhdfs/v1/",
                "gatewayName": "mygateway"
            }
        }
    }

**Azure Storage linked service**

    {
      "name": "AzureStorageLinkedService",
      "properties": {
        "type": "AzureStorage",
        "typeProperties": {
          "connectionString": "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=<accountname>;AccountKey=<accountkey>"
        }
      }
    }

**HDFS input dataset**
This dataset refers to the HDFS folder DataTransfer/UnitTest/. The pipeline copies all the files int his folder to the destination. 

Setting “external”: ”true” and specifying externalData policy (optional) informs the Data Factory service that the table is external to the data factory and not produced by an activity in the data factory.

    {
        "name": "InputDataset",
        "properties": {
            "type": "FileShare",
            "linkedServiceName": "HDFSLinkedService",
            "typeProperties": {
                "folderPath": "DataTransfer/UnitTest/"
            },
            "external": true,
            "availability": {
                "frequency": "Hour",
                "interval":  1
            }
        }
    }




**Azure Blob output dataset**

Data is written to a new blob every hour (frequency: hour, interval: 1). The folder path for the blob is dynamically evaluated based on the start time of the slice that is being processed. The folder path uses year, month, day, and hours parts of the start time.

    {
        "name": "OutputDataset",
        "properties": {
            "type": "AzureBlob",
            "linkedServiceName": "AzureStorageLinkedService",
            "typeProperties": {
                "folderPath": "mycontainer/hdfs/yearno={Year}/monthno={Month}/dayno={Day}/hourno={Hour}",
                "format": {
                    "type": "TextFormat",
                    "rowDelimiter": "\n",
                    "columnDelimiter": "\t"
                },
                "partitionedBy": [
                    {
                        "name": "Year",
                        "value": {
                            "type": "DateTime",
                            "date": "SliceStart",
                            "format": "yyyy"
                        }
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "Month",
                        "value": {
                            "type": "DateTime",
                            "date": "SliceStart",
                            "format": "MM"
                        }
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "Day",
                        "value": {
                            "type": "DateTime",
                            "date": "SliceStart",
                            "format": "dd"
                        }
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "Hour",
                        "value": {
                            "type": "DateTime",
                            "date": "SliceStart",
                            "format": "HH"
                        }
                    }
                ]
            },
            "availability": {
                "frequency": "Hour",
                "interval": 1
            }
        }
    }



**Pipeline with Copy activity**

The pipeline contains a Copy Activity that is configured to use the above input and output datasets and is scheduled to run every hour. In the pipeline JSON definition, the **source** type is set to **FileSystemSource** and **sink** type is set to **BlobSink**. The SQL query specified for the **query** property selects the data in the past hour to copy.

                        },
                        "sink":
                        {
                            "type": "BlobSink"
                        }
                    },
                    "policy":
                    {

                "gatewayName": "mygateway"
            }
        }
    }



## HDFS Dataset type properties
For a full list of sections & properties available for defining datasets, see the [Creating datasets](data-factory-create-datasets.md) article. Sections like structure, availability, and policy of a dataset JSON are similar for all dataset types (Azure SQL, Azure blob, Azure table, etc...).

The **typeProperties** section is different for each type of dataset and provides information about the location of the data in the data store. The typeProperties section for dataset of type **FileShare** (which includes HDFS dataset) has the following properties

| Property | Description | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| folderPath |Path to the folder. Example: myfolder<br/><br/>Use escape character ‘ \ ’ for special characters in the string. For example: for folder\subfolder, specify folder\\\\subfolder and for d:\samplefolder, specify d:\\\\samplefolder.<br/><br/>You can combine this with **partitionBy** to have folder paths based on slice start/end date-times. |Yes |
| fileName |Specify the name of the file in the **folderPath** if you want the table to refer to a specific file in the folder. If you do not specify any value for this property, the table points to all files in the folder.<br/><br/>When fileName is not specified for an output dataset, the name of the generated file would be in the following this format: <br/><br/>Data.<Guid>.txt (for example: : Data.0a405f8a-93ff-4c6f-b3be-f69616f1df7a.txt |No |
| partitionedBy |partitionedBy can be leveraged to specify a dynamic folderPath, filename for time series data. For example folderPath parameterized for every hour of data. |No |
| fileFilter |Specify a filter to be used to select a subset of files in the folderPath rather than all files. <br/><br/>Allowed values are: * (multiple characters) and ? (single character).<br/><br/>Examples 1: "fileFilter": "*.log"<br/>Example 2: "fileFilter": 2014-1-?.txt"<br/><br/>**Note**: fileFilter is applicable for an input FileShare dataset |No |
|  |compression |Specify the type and level of compression for the data. Supported types are: **GZip**, **Deflate**, and **BZip2** and supported levels are: **Optimal** and **Fastest**. Note that compression settings are not supported for data in **AvroFormat** or **OrcFormat** at this time. See [Compression support](#compression-support) section for more details. |No | |
|  |format |The following format types are supported: **TextFormat**, **AvroFormat**, **JsonFormat**, **OrcFormat**. You need to set the **type** property under format to one of these values. See [Specifying TextFormat](#specifying-textformat), [Specifying AvroFormat](#specifying-avroformat), [Specifying JsonFormat](#specifying-jsonformat), [Specifying OrcFormat](#specifying-orcformat) sections for details. If you want to copy files as-is between file-based stores (binary copy), you can skip the format section in both input and output dataset definitions. |No  |

> [!NOTE]
> filename and fileFilter cannot be used simultaneously.
> 
> 

### Leveraging partionedBy property
As mentioned above, you can specify a dynamic folderPath, filename for time series data with partitionedBy. You can do so with the Data Factory macros and the system variable SliceStart, SliceEnd that indicate the logical time period for a given data slice. 

See [Creating Datasets](data-factory-create-datasets.md), [Scheduling & Execution](data-factory-scheduling-and-execution.md), and [Creating Pipelines](data-factory-create-pipelines.md) articles to understand more details on time series datasets, scheduling and slices.

#### Sample 1:
    "folderPath": "wikidatagateway/wikisampledataout/{Slice}",
    "partitionedBy": 
    [
        { "name": "Slice", "value": { "type": "DateTime", "date": "SliceStart", "format": "yyyyMMddHH" } },
    ],

In the above example {Slice} is replaced with the value of Data Factory system variable SliceStart in the format (YYYYMMDDHH) specified. The SliceStart refers to start time of the slice. The folderPath is different for each slice. For example: wikidatagateway/wikisampledataout/2014100103 or wikidatagateway/wikisampledataout/2014100104.

#### Sample 2:
    "folderPath": "wikidatagateway/wikisampledataout/{Year}/{Month}/{Day}",
    "fileName": "{Hour}.csv",
    "partitionedBy": 
     [
        { "name": "Year", "value": { "type": "DateTime", "date": "SliceStart", "format": "yyyy" } },
        { "name": "Month", "value": { "type": "DateTime", "date": "SliceStart", "format": "MM" } }, 
        { "name": "Day", "value": { "type": "DateTime", "date": "SliceStart", "format": "dd" } }, 
        { "name": "Hour", "value": { "type": "DateTime", "date": "SliceStart", "format": "hh" } } 
    ],

In the above example, year, month, day, and time of SliceStart are extracted into separate variables that are used by folderPath and fileName properties.

## HDFS Copy Activity type properties
For a full list of sections & properties available for defining activities, see the [Creating Pipelines](data-factory-create-pipelines.md) article. Properties like name, description, input and output tables, various policies etc. are available for all types of activities. 

Properties available in the typeProperties section of the activity on the other hand vary with each activity type and in case of Copy activity they vary depending on the types of sources and sinks.

In case of Copy Activity when source is of type **FileSystemSource** the following properties are available in typeProperties section:

**FileSystemSource** supports the following properties:

| Property | Description | Allowed values | Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| recursive |Indicates whether the data is read recursively from the sub folders or only from the specified folder. |True, False (default) |No |

[!INCLUDE [data-factory-column-mapping](../../includes/data-factory-column-mapping.md)]
