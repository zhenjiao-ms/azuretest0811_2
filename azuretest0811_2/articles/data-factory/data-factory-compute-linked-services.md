# Compute Linked Services
This article explains different compute environments that you can use to process or transform data. It also provides details about different configurations (on-demand vs. bring your own) supported by Data Factory when configuring linked services linking these compute environments to an Azure data factory.

## On-demand compute environment
In this type of configuration, the computing environment is fully managed by the Azure Data Factory service. It is automatically created by the Data Factory service before a job is submitted to process data and removed when the job is completed. You can create a linked service for the on-demand compute environment, configure it, and control granular settings for job execution, cluster management, and bootstrapping actions.

> [!NOTE]
> The on-demand configuration is currently supported only for Azure HDInsight clusters.
> 
> 

## Azure HDInsight On-Demand Linked Service
The Azure Data Factory service can automatically create a Windows/Linux-based on-demand HDInsight cluster to process data. The cluster is created in the region that is same as that of the storage account (linkedServiceName property in the JSON) associated with the cluster.

Note the following **important** points about on-demand HDInsight linked service:

* You will not see the on-demand HDInsight cluster created in your Azure subscription; the Azure Data Factory service manages the on-demand HDInsight cluster on your behalf.
* The logs for jobs that are run on an on-demand HDInsight cluster are copied to the storage account associated with the HDInsight cluster. You can access these logs from the Azure Portal in the **Activity Run Details** blade. See [Monitor and Manage Pipelines](data-factory-monitor-manage-pipelines.md) article for details.
* You will be charged only for the time when the HDInsight cluster is up and running jobs.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It typically takes more than **15 minutes** to provision an Azure HDInsight cluster on demand.

### Example
The following JSON defines a Linux-based on-demand HDInsight linked service. The Data Factory service automatically creates a **Linux-based** HDInsight cluster when processing a data slice. 

    {
        "name": "HDInsightOnDemandLinkedService",
        "properties": {
            "type": "HDInsightOnDemand",
            "typeProperties": {
                "clusterSize": 4,
                "timeToLive": "00:05:00",
                "osType": "linux",
                "linkedServiceName": "StorageLinkedService"
            }
        }
    }

To use a Windows-based HDInsight cluster, set **osType** to **windows** or do not use the property as the default value is: windows.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The HDInsight cluster creates a **default container** in the blob storage you specified in the JSON (**linkedServiceName**). HDInsight does not delete this container when the cluster is deleted. This is by design. With on-demand HDInsight linked service, a HDInsight cluster is created every time a slice needs to be processed unless there is an existing live cluster (**timeToLive**) and is deleted when the processing is done. 
> 
> As more and more slices are processed, you will see a lot of containers in your Azure blob storage. If you do not need them for troubleshooting of the jobs, you may want to delete them to reduce the storage cost. The name of these containers follow a pattern: "adf**yourdatafactoryname**-**linkedservicename**-datetimestamp". Use tools such as [Microsoft Storage Explorer](http://storageexplorer.com/) to delete containers in your Azure blob storage.

### Properties
| Property | Description | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| type |The type property should be set to **HDInsightOnDemand**. |Yes |
| clusterSize |Number of worker/data nodes in the cluster. The HDInsight cluster is created with 2 head nodes along with the number of worker nodes you specify for this property. The nodes are of size Standard_D3 that has 4 cores, so a 4 worker node cluster will take 24 cores (4*4 for worker nodes + 2*4 for head nodes). See [Create Linux-based Hadoop clusters in HDInsight](../hdinsight/hdinsight-hadoop-provision-linux-clusters.md) for details about the Standard_D3 tier. |Yes |
| timetolive |The allowed idle time for the on-demand HDInsight cluster. Specifies how long the on-demand HDInsight cluster will stay alive after completion of an activity run if there are no other active jobs in the cluster.<br/><br/>For example, if an activity run takes 6 minutes and timetolive is set to 5 minutes, the cluster stays alive for 5 minutes after the 6 minutes of processing the activity run. If another activity run is executed with the 6 minutes window, it is processed by the same cluster.<br/><br/>Creating an on-demand HDInsight cluster is an expensive operation (could take a while), so use this setting as needed to improve performance of a data factory by reusing an on-demand HDInsight cluster.<br/><br/>If you set timetolive value to 0, the cluster is deleted as soon as the activity run in processed. On the other hand, if you set a high value, the cluster may stay idle unnecessarily resulting in high costs. Therefore, it is important that you set the appropriate value based on your needs.<br/><br/>Multiple pipelines can share the same instance of the on-demand HDInsight cluster if the timetolive property value is appropriately set |Yes |
| version |Version of the HDInsight cluster. The default value is 3.1 for Windows cluster and 3.2 for Linux cluster. |No |
| linkedServiceName |The blob store to be used by the on-demand cluster for storing and processing data. |Yes |
| additionalLinkedServiceNames |Specifies additional storage accounts for the HDInsight linked service so that the Data Factory service can register them on your behalf. |No |
| osType |Type of operating system. Allowed values are: Windows (default) and Linux |No |
| hcatalogLinkedServiceName |The name of Azure SQL linked service that point to the HCatalog database. The on-demand HDInsight cluster will be created by using the Azure SQL database as the metastore. |No |

#### additionalLinkedServiceNames JSON example
    "additionalLinkedServiceNames": [
        "otherLinkedServiceName1",
        "otherLinkedServiceName2"
      ]

### Advanced Properties
You can also specify the following properties for the granular configuration of the on-demand HDInsight cluster.

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| coreConfiguration |Specifies the core configuration parameters (as in core-site.xml) for the HDInsight cluster to be created. |No |
| hBaseConfiguration |Specifies the HBase configuration parameters (hbase-site.xml) for the HDInsight cluster. |No |
| hdfsConfiguration |Specifies the HDFS configuration parameters (hdfs-site.xml) for the HDInsight cluster. |No |
| hiveConfiguration |Specifies the hive configuration parameters (hive-site.xml) for the HDInsight cluster. |No |
| mapReduceConfiguration |Specifies the MapReduce configuration parameters (mapred-site.xml) for the HDInsight cluster. |No |
| oozieConfiguration |Specifies the Oozie configuration parameters (oozie-site.xml) for the HDInsight cluster. |No |
| stormConfiguration |Specifies the Storm configuration parameters (storm-site.xml) for the HDInsight cluster. |No |
| yarnConfiguration |Specifies the Yarn configuration parameters (yarn-site.xml) for the HDInsight cluster. |No |

#### Example â€“ On-demand HDInsight cluster configuration with advanced properties
    {
      "name": " HDInsightOnDemandLinkedService",
      "properties": {
        "type": "HDInsightOnDemand",
        "typeProperties": {
          "clusterSize": 16,
          "timeToLive": "01:30:00",
          "linkedServiceName": "adfods1",
          "coreConfiguration": {
            "templeton.mapper.memory.mb": "5000"
          },
          "hiveConfiguration": {
            "templeton.mapper.memory.mb": "5000"
          },
          "mapReduceConfiguration": {
            "mapreduce.reduce.java.opts": "-Xmx4000m",
            "mapreduce.map.java.opts": "-Xmx4000m",
            "mapreduce.map.memory.mb": "5000",
            "mapreduce.reduce.memory.mb": "5000",
            "mapreduce.job.reduce.slowstart.completedmaps": "0.8"
          },
          "yarnConfiguration": {
            "yarn.app.mapreduce.am.resource.mb": "5000",
            "mapreduce.map.memory.mb": "5000"
          },
          "additionalLinkedServiceNames": [
            "datafeeds",
            "adobedatafeed"
          ]
        }
      }
    }

### Node sizes
You can specify the sizes of head, data, and zookeeper nodes using the following properties. 

| Property | Description | Required |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |
| headNodeSize |Specifies the size of the head node. The default value is: Standard_D3. See the **Specifying node sizes** section below for details. |No |
| dataNodeSize |Specifies the size of the data node. The default value is: Standard_D3. |No |
| zookeeperNodeSize |Specifies the size of the Zoo Keeper node. The default value is: Standard_D3. |No |

#### Specifying node sizes
Please see the [Sizes of Virtual Machines](../virtual-machines/virtual-machines-linux-sizes.md#size-tables) article for string values you need to specify for the above properties. The values need to conform to the **CMDLETs & APIS** referenced in the article. As you can see in the article, the data node of Large (default) size has 7 GB memory, which may not be good enough for your scenario. 

If you want to create D4 sized head nodes and worker nodes, you need to specify **Standard_D4** as the value for headNodeSize and dataNodeSize properties. 

    "headNodeSize": "Standard_D4",    
    "dataNodeSize": "Standard_D4",

If you specify a wrong value for these properties, you may receive the following **error:**    Failed to create cluster. Exception: Unable to complete the cluster create operation. Operation failed with code '400'. Cluster left behind state: 'Error'. Message: 'PreClusterCreationValidationFailure'. When you receive this error, ensure that you are using the **CMDLET & APIS** name from the table in the above article.  

## Bring your own compute environment
In this type of configuration, users can register an already existing computing environment as a linked service in Data Factory. The computing environment is managed by the user and the Data Factory service uses it to execute the activities.

This type of configuration is supported for the following compute environments:

* Azure HDInsight
* Azure Batch
* Azure Machine Learning.

## Azure HDInsight Linked Service
You can create an Azure HDInsight linked service to register your own HDInsight cluster with Data Factory.

      "properties": {
        "type": "HDInsight",
        "typeProperties": {
          "clusterUri": " https://<hdinsightclustername>.azurehdinsight.net/",
          "userName": "admin",
          "password": "<password>",
          "linkedServiceName": "MyHDInsightStoragelinkedService"
        }
      }
    }

## Azure Batch Linked Service
You can create an Azure Batch linked service to register a Batch pool of virtual machines (VMs) to a data factory. You can run .NET custom activities using either Azure Batch or Azure HDInsight.

See following topics if you are new to Azure Batch service:

* [Azure Batch basics](../batch/batch-technical-overview.md) for an overview of the Azure Batch service.
* [New-AzureBatchAccount](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt125880.aspx) cmdlet to create an Azure Batch account (or) [Azure Portal](../batch/batch-account-create-portal.md) to create the Azure Batch account using Azure Portal. See [Using PowerShell to manage Azure Batch Account](http://blogs.technet.com/b/windowshpc/archive/2014/10/28/using-azure-powershell-to-manage-azure-batch-account.aspx) topic for detailed instructions on using the cmdlet.

### Example
    {
      "name": "AzureBatchLinkedService",
      "properties": {
        "type": "AzureBatch",
        "typeProperties": {
          "accountName": "<Azure Batch account name>",
          "accessKey": "<Azure Batch account key>",
          "poolName": "<Azure Batch pool name>",
          "linkedServiceName": "<Specify associated storage linked service reference here>"
        }
      }
    }

Append "**.<region name**" to the name of your batch account for the **accountName** property. Example:

            "accountName": "mybatchaccount.eastus"

Another option is to provide the batchUri endpoint as shown below.  

            "accountName": "adfteam",
            "batchUri": "https://eastus.batch.azure.com",

### Properties

## Azure Data Lake Analytics Linked Service
You create an **Azure Data Lake Analytics** linked service to link an Azure Data Lake Analytics compute service to an Azure data factory before using the [Data Lake Analytics U-SQL activity](data-factory-usql-activity.md) in a pipeline.

The following example provides JSON definition for an Azure Data Lake Analytics linked service.

    {
        "name": "AzureDataLakeAnalyticsLinkedService",
        "properties": {
            "type": "AzureDataLakeAnalytics",
            "typeProperties": {
                "accountName": "adftestaccount",
                "dataLakeAnalyticsUri": "datalakeanalyticscompute.net",
                "authorization": "<authcode>",
                "sessionId": "<session ID>",
                "subscriptionId": "<subscription id>",
                "resourceGroupName": "<resource group name>"
            }
        }
    }


The following table provides descriptions for the properties used in the JSON definition.

| Property | Description | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Type |The type property should be set to: **AzureDataLakeAnalytics**. |Yes |
| accountName |Azure Data Lake Analytics Account Name. |Yes |
| dataLakeAnalyticsUri |Azure Data Lake Analytics URI. |No |
| authorization |Authorization code is automatically retrieved after clicking **Authorize** button in the Data Factory Editor and completing the OAuth login. |Yes |
| subscriptionId |Azure subscription id |No (If not specified, subscription of the data factory is used). |
| resourceGroupName |Azure resource group name |No (If not specified, resource group of the data factory is used). |
| sessionId |session id from the OAuth authorization session. Each session id is unique and may only be used once. This is auto-generated in the Data Factory Editor. |Yes |

The authorization code you generated by using the **Authorize** button expires after sometime. See the following table for the expiration times for different types of user accounts. You may see the following error message when the authentication **token expires**: Credential operation error: invalid_grant - AADSTS70002: Error validating credentials. AADSTS70008: The provided access grant is expired or revoked. Trace ID: d18629e8-af88-43c5-88e3-d8419eb1fca1 Correlation ID: fac30a0c-6be6-4e02-8d69-a776d2ffefd7 Timestamp: 2015-12-15 21:09:31Z

| User type | Expires after |
|:--- |:--- |
| User accounts NOT managed by Azure Active Directory (@hotmail.com, @live.com, etc.) |12 hours |
| Users accounts managed by Azure Active Directory (AAD) |14 days after the last slice run. <br/><br/>90 days, if a slice based on OAuth-based linked service runs at least once every 14 days. |

To avoid/resolve this error, you will need to reauthorize using the **Authorize** button when the **token expires** and redeploy the linked service. You can also generate values for sessionId and authorization properties programmatically using code in the following section. 

### To programmatically generate sessionId and authorization values
The following code generates **sessionId** and **authorization** values.  

    if (linkedService.Properties.TypeProperties is AzureDataLakeStoreLinkedService ||
        linkedService.Properties.TypeProperties is AzureDataLakeAnalyticsLinkedService)
    {
        AuthorizationSessionGetResponse authorizationSession = this.Client.OAuth.Get(this.ResourceGroupName, this.DataFactoryName, linkedService.Properties.Type);

        WindowsFormsWebAuthenticationDialog authenticationDialog = new WindowsFormsWebAuthenticationDialog(null);
        string authorization = authenticationDialog.AuthenticateAAD(authorizationSession.AuthorizationSession.Endpoint, new Uri("urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob"));

        AzureDataLakeStoreLinkedService azureDataLakeStoreProperties = linkedService.Properties.TypeProperties as AzureDataLakeStoreLinkedService;
        if (azureDataLakeStoreProperties != null)
        {
            azureDataLakeStoreProperties.SessionId = authorizationSession.AuthorizationSession.SessionId;
            azureDataLakeStoreProperties.Authorization = authorization;
        }

        AzureDataLakeAnalyticsLinkedService azureDataLakeAnalyticsProperties = linkedService.Properties.TypeProperties as AzureDataLakeAnalyticsLinkedService;
        if (azureDataLakeAnalyticsProperties != null)
        {
            azureDataLakeAnalyticsProperties.SessionId = authorizationSession.AuthorizationSession.SessionId;
            azureDataLakeAnalyticsProperties.Authorization = authorization;
        }
    }

See [AzureDataLakeStoreLinkedService Class](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.azure.management.datafactories.models.azuredatalakestorelinkedservice.aspx), [AzureDataLakeAnalyticsLinkedService Class](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.azure.management.datafactories.models.azuredatalakeanalyticslinkedservice.aspx), and [AuthorizationSessionGetResponse Class](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.azure.management.datafactories.models.authorizationsessiongetresponse.aspx) topics for details about the Data Factory classes used in the code. You need to add a reference to: Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory.WindowsForms.dll for the WindowsFormsWebAuthenticationDialog class. 

## Azure SQL Linked Service
You create an Azure SQL linked service and use it with the [Stored Procedure Activity](data-factory-stored-proc-activity.md) to invoke a stored procedure from a Data Factory pipeline. See [Azure SQL Connector](data-factory-azure-sql-connector.md#azure-sql-linked-service-properties) article for details about this linked service.

## Azure SQL Data Warehouse Linked Service
You create an Azure SQL Data Warehouse linked service and use it with the [Stored Procedure Activity](data-factory-stored-proc-activity.md) to invoke a stored procedure from a Data Factory pipeline. See [Azure SQL Data Warehouse Connector](data-factory-azure-sql-data-warehouse-connector.md#azure-sql-data-warehouse-linked-service-properties) article for details about this linked service.

## SQL Server Linked Service
You create a SQL Server linked service and use it with the [Stored Procedure Activity](data-factory-stored-proc-activity.md) to invoke a stored procedure from a Data Factory pipeline. See [SQL Server connector](data-factory-sqlserver-connector.md#sql-server-linked-service-properties) article for details about this linked service.
