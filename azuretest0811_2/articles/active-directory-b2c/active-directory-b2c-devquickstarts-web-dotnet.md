# Azure AD B2C: Build a .NET web app
<!-- TODO [AZURE.INCLUDE [active-directory-b2c-devquickstarts-web-switcher](../../includes/active-directory-b2c-devquickstarts-web-switcher.md)]-->

By using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) B2C, you can add powerful self-service identity management features to your web app in a few short steps. This article will discuss how to create a .NET Model-View-Controller (MVC) web app that includes user sign-up, sign-in, and profile management. The app will include support for sign-up and sign-in by using a user name or email, and by using social accounts such as Facebook and Google.

## Get an Azure AD B2C directory
Before you can use Azure AD B2C, you must create a directory, or tenant. A directory is a container for all of your users, apps, groups, and more.  If you don't have one already, [create a B2C directory](active-directory-b2c-get-started.md) before you continue in this guide.

## Create an application
Next, you need to create an app in your B2C directory. This gives Azure AD information that it needs to securely communicate with your app. To create an app, follow [these instructions](active-directory-b2c-app-registration.md).  Be sure to:

* Include a **web app/web API** in the application.
* Enter `https://localhost:44316/` as a **Redirect URI**. It is the default URL for this code sample.
* Copy down the **Application ID** that is assigned to your app.  You will need it later.

[!INCLUDE [active-directory-b2c-devquickstarts-v2-apps](../../includes/active-directory-b2c-devquickstarts-v2-apps.md)]

## Create your policies
In Azure AD B2C, every user experience is defined by a [policy](active-directory-b2c-reference-policies.md). This code sample contains three identity experiences: sign up, sign in, and edit profile. You need to create one policy of each type, as described in the [policy reference article](active-directory-b2c-reference-policies.md#how-to-create-a-sign-up-policy).

> [!NOTE]
> Azure AD B2C also supports a combined sign up or sign in policy which is not featured in this tutorial.  The sign up or sign in policy is shown in [this equivalent tutorial](active-directory-b2c-devquickstarts-web-dotnet-susi.md).
> 
> 

When you create the three policies, be sure to:

* Choose **User ID sign-up** or **Email sign-up** in the identity providers blade.
* Choose the **Display name** and other sign-up attributes in your sign-up policy.
* Choose the **Display name** claim as an application claim in every policy. You can choose other claims as well.
* Copy the **Name** of each policy after you create it. You'll need those policy names later.

[!INCLUDE [active-directory-b2c-devquickstarts-policy](../../includes/active-directory-b2c-devquickstarts-policy.md)]

After you create your three policies, you're ready to build your app.  

## Download the code and configure authentication
The code for this sample [is maintained on GitHub](https://github.com/AzureADQuickStarts/B2C-WebApp-OpenIdConnect-DotNet). To build the sample as you go, you can [download the skeleton project as a .zip file](https://github.com/AzureADQuickStarts/B2C-WebApp-OpenIdConnect-DotNet/archive/skeleton.zip). You can also clone the skeleton:

```
git clone --branch skeleton https://github.com/AzureADQuickStarts/B2C-WebApp-OpenIdConnect-DotNet.git
```

The completed sample is also [available as a .zip file](https://github.com/AzureADQuickStarts/B2C-WebApp-OpenIdConnect-DotNet/archive/complete.zip) or on the `complete` branch of the same repository.

After you download the sample code, open the Visual Studio .sln file to get started.

Your app communicates with Azure AD B2C by sending authentication messages that specify the policy they want to execute as part of the HTTP request. For .NET web applications, you can use Microsoft's OWIN middleware to send OpenID Connect authentication requests, execute policies, manage user sessions, and more.

To begin, add the OWIN middleware NuGet packages to the project by using the Visual Studio Package Manager Console.

```
PM> Install-Package Microsoft.Owin.Security.OpenIdConnect
PM> Install-Package Microsoft.Owin.Security.Cookies
PM> Install-Package Microsoft.Owin.Host.SystemWeb
```

Next, open the `web.config` file in the root of the project and enter your app's configuration values in the `<appSettings>` section, replacing the existing values.

```
<configuration>
  <appSettings>
    <add key="webpages:Version" value="3.0.0.0" />
    <add key="webpages:Enabled" value="false" />
    <add key="ClientValidationEnabled" value="true" />
    <add key="UnobtrusiveJavaScriptEnabled" value="true" />
    <add key="ida:Tenant" value="fabrikamb2c.onmicrosoft.com" />
    <add key="ida:ClientId" value="90c0fe63-bcf2-44d5-8fb7-b8bbc0b29dc6" />
    <add key="ida:AadInstance" value="https://login.microsoftonline.com/{0}/v2.0/.well-known/openid-configuration?p={1}" />
    <add key="ida:RedirectUri" value="https://localhost:44316/" />
    <add key="ida:SignUpPolicyId" value="b2c_1_sign_up" />
    <add key="ida:SignInPolicyId" value="b2c_1_sign_in" />
    <add key="ida:UserProfilePolicyId" value="b2c_1_edit_profile" />
  </appSettings>
...
```

[!INCLUDE [active-directory-b2c-tenant-name](../../includes/active-directory-b2c-devquickstarts-tenant-name.md)]

Next, add an OWIN startup class to the project called `Startup.cs`. Right-click on the project, select **Add** and **New Item**, and then Search for "OWIN." **Make sure to change the class declaration to `public partial class Startup`**. We implemented part of this class for you in another file. The OWIN middleware will invoke the `Configuration(...)` method when your app starts. In this method, make a call to `ConfigureAuth(...)`, where you set up authentication for your app.

```C#
// Startup.cs

public partial class Startup
{
    public void Configuration(IAppBuilder app)
    {
        ConfigureAuth(app);
    }
}
```

Open the file `App_Start\Startup.Auth.cs` and implement the `ConfigureAuth(...)` method.  The parameters you provide in `OpenIdConnectAuthenticationOptions` serve as coordinates for your app to communicate with Azure AD. You also need to set up cookie authentication. The OpenID Connect middleware uses cookies to maintain user sessions, among other things.

```C#
// App_Start\Startup.Auth.cs

public partial class Startup
{
    // App config settings
    private static string clientId = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ida:ClientId"];
    private static string aadInstance = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ida:AadInstance"];
    private static string tenant = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ida:Tenant"];
    private static string redirectUri = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ida:RedirectUri"];

    // B2C policy identifiers
    public static string SignUpPolicyId = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ida:SignUpPolicyId"];
    public static string SignInPolicyId = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ida:SignInPolicyId"];
    public static string ProfilePolicyId = ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["ida:UserProfilePolicyId"];

    public void ConfigureAuth(IAppBuilder app)
    {
        app.SetDefaultSignInAsAuthenticationType(CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationType);

        app.UseCookieAuthentication(new CookieAuthenticationOptions());

        // Configure OpenID Connect middleware for each policy
        app.UseOpenIdConnectAuthentication(CreateOptionsFromPolicy(SignUpPolicyId));
        app.UseOpenIdConnectAuthentication(CreateOptionsFromPolicy(ProfilePolicyId));
        app.UseOpenIdConnectAuthentication(CreateOptionsFromPolicy(SignInPolicyId));
    }

    // Used for avoiding yellow-screen-of-death
    private Task AuthenticationFailed(AuthenticationFailedNotification<OpenIdConnectMessage, OpenIdConnectAuthenticationOptions> notification)
    {
        notification.HandleResponse();
        if (notification.Exception.Message == "access_denied")
        {
            notification.Response.Redirect("/");
        }
        else
        {
            notification.Response.Redirect("/Home/Error?message=" + notification.Exception.Message);
        }

        return Task.FromResult(0);
    }

    private OpenIdConnectAuthenticationOptions CreateOptionsFromPolicy(string policy)
    {
        return new OpenIdConnectAuthenticationOptions
        {
            // For each policy, give OWIN the policy-specific metadata address, and
            // set the authentication type to the id of the policy
            MetadataAddress = String.Format(aadInstance, tenant, policy),
            AuthenticationType = policy,

            // These are standard OpenID Connect parameters, with values pulled from web.config
            ClientId = clientId,
            RedirectUri = redirectUri,
            PostLogoutRedirectUri = redirectUri,
            Notifications = new OpenIdConnectAuthenticationNotifications
            {
                AuthenticationFailed = AuthenticationFailed,
            },
            Scope = "openid",
            ResponseType = "id_token",

            // This piece is optional - it is used for displaying the user's name in the navigation bar.
            TokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters
            {
                NameClaimType = "name",
            },
        };
    }
}
```

## Send authentication requests to Azure AD
Your app is now properly configured to communicate with Azure AD B2C by using the OpenID Connect authentication protocol.  OWIN has taken care of all of the details of crafting authentication messages, validating tokens from Azure AD, and maintaining user session.  All that remains is to initiate each user's flow.

When a user selects **Sign up**, **Sign in**, or **Edit profile** in the web app, the associated action is invoked in `Controllers\AccountController.cs`. In each case, you can use built-in OWIN methods to trigger the right policy:

```C#
// Controllers\AccountController.cs

public void SignIn()
{
    if (!Request.IsAuthenticated)
    {
        // To execute a policy, you simply need to trigger an OWIN challenge.
        // You can indicate which policy to use by specifying the policy id as the AuthenticationType
        HttpContext.GetOwinContext().Authentication.Challenge(
            new AuthenticationProperties () { RedirectUri = "/" }, Startup.SignInPolicyId);
    }
}

public void SignUp()
{
    if (!Request.IsAuthenticated)
    {
        HttpContext.GetOwinContext().Authentication.Challenge(
            new AuthenticationProperties() { RedirectUri = "/" }, Startup.SignUpPolicyId);
    }
}


public void Profile()
{
    if (Request.IsAuthenticated)
    {
        HttpContext.GetOwinContext().Authentication.Challenge(
            new AuthenticationProperties() { RedirectUri = "/" }, Startup.ProfilePolicyId);
    }
}
```

You can also use an `[Authorize]` tag in your controllers that requires the execution of a certain policy if the user is not signed in. Open `Controllers\HomeController.cs` and add the `[Authorize]` tag to the claims controller.  OWIN will select the last policy configured to execute when the Authorize tag is invoked.

```C#
// Controllers\HomeController.cs

// You can use the Authorize decorator to execute a policy if the user is not already signed in the app.
[Authorize]
public ActionResult Claims()
{
  ...
```

You can also use OWIN to sign out the user from the app. In `Controllers\AccountController.cs`:  

```C#
// Controllers\AccountController.cs

public void SignOut()
{
    // To sign out the user, you should issue an OpenIDConnect sign out request
    if (Request.IsAuthenticated)
    {
        IEnumerable<AuthenticationDescription> authTypes = HttpContext.GetOwinContext().Authentication.GetAuthenticationTypes();
        HttpContext.GetOwinContext().Authentication.SignOut(authTypes.Select(t => t.AuthenticationType).ToArray());
        Request.GetOwinContext().Authentication.GetAuthenticationTypes();
    }
}
```

## Display user information
When you authenticate users by using OpenID Connect, Azure AD returns an ID token to the app that contains **claims**. These are assertions about the user. You can use claims to personalize your app.  

Open the `Controllers\HomeController.cs` file. You can access user claims in your controllers via the `ClaimsPrincipal.Current` security principal object.

```C#
// Controllers\HomeController.cs

[Authorize]
public ActionResult Claims()
{
    Claim displayName = ClaimsPrincipal.Current.FindFirst(ClaimsPrincipal.Current.Identities.First().NameClaimType);
    ViewBag.DisplayName = displayName != null ? displayName.Value : string.Empty;
    return View();
}
```

You can access any claim that your application receives in the same way.  A list of all the claims the app receives is available for you on the **Claims** page.

## Run the sample app
Finally, you can build and run your app. Sign up for the app by using an email address or user name. Sign out and sign back in as the same user. Edit that user's profile. Sign out and sign up as a different user. Note that the information displayed on the **Claims** tab corresponds to the information that you configured on your policies.

## Add social IDPs
Currently, the app supports only user sign-up and sign-in by using **local accounts**. These are accounts stored in your B2C directory that use a user name and password. By using Azure AD B2C, you can add support for other **identity providers** (IDPs) without changing any of your code.

To add social IDPs to your app, begin by following the detailed instructions in these articles. For each IDP you want to support, you need to register an application in that system and obtain a client ID.

* [Set up Facebook as an IDP](active-directory-b2c-setup-fb-app.md)
* [Set up Google as an IDP](active-directory-b2c-setup-goog-app.md)
* [Set up Amazon as an IDP](active-directory-b2c-setup-amzn-app.md)
* [Set up LinkedIn as an IDP](active-directory-b2c-setup-li-app.md)

After you add the identity providers to your B2C directory, you need to edit each of your three policies to include the new IDPs, as described in the [policy reference article](active-directory-b2c-reference-policies.md). After you save your policies, run the app again.  You should see the new IDPs added as sign-in and sign-up options in each of your identity experiences.

You can experiment with your policies and observe the effect on your sample app. Add or remove IDPs, manipulate application claims, or change sign-up attributes. Experiment until you can see how policies, authentication requests, and OWIN tie together.
