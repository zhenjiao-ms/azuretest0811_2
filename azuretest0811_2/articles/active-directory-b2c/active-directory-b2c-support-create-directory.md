# Creating an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant or Azure AD B2C tenant: Issues and resolutions
## Creating an Azure AD tenant
If you can't create an Azure AD tenant the first time, please try again. If the problem persists, contact Support.

## Creating an Azure AD B2C tenant
If you encounter issues during the [creation of an Azure AD B2C tenant](active-directory-b2c-get-started.md), try the following:

* If the Azure AD B2C tenant doesn't show up in your list of tenants, please try again.
* If the Azure AD B2C tenant does show up in your list of tenants and you receive an error message ("Could not complete the creation of the B2C tenant 'contosob2c'. Please visit this [link](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=624192&clcid=0x409) for more guidance."), delete the tenant that you just created and try again.
* If these resolutions don't work for you, contact Support. Learn more about [how to file support requests for Azure AD B2C](active-directory-b2c-support.md).
