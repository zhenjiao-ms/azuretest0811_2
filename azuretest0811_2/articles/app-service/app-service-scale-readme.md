# Azure App Service: Scaling App Service Applications
Applications hosted in Azure App Service can [achieve massive scale](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/canadian-broadcasting-corporation-radio-canada-leverage-azure-for-smooth-election-coverage/).
However, scaling an application is a complex problem that does not have a "one 
size fits all" solution. To correctly scale your application there are 3 key
areas that will contribute to your applications success:

1. Understanding your application architecture and its weaknesses.
   * Is your Application Stateful? Stateless?
   * What are all the components of your application?
     * Where are the bottlenecks in the application?
   * When load is applied to your app, what will break first?
2. Understanding the expected load and performance requirements.
   * Does the application need to serve one thousand users? or one million?
   * Will traffic come from a single geographic location or globally?
   * Are there seasonal variations? traffic peaks?
   * How fast should the app respond? 1 second? 1 millisecond?
3. Understanding and correctly leverage the platform hosting your app.
   * What features should I leverage to achieve my scale goals?

This section will help you understand all the factors and help you device a
strategy that takes advantage of the necessary App Service features to achieve
your scalability goals.
