If you've received an error when deploying resources to Azure, you may want to see more details about the deployment operations that were executed. The REST API provides operations that enable you to find the errors and determine potential fixes.

[!INCLUDE [resource-manager-troubleshoot-introduction](../includes/resource-manager-troubleshoot-introduction.md)]

You can avoid some errors by validating your template and infrastructure prior to deployment. You can also log additional request and response information during deployment that may be helpful later for troubleshooting. To learn about validating, and logging request and response information, see [Deploy a resource group with Azure Resource Manager template](resource-group-template-deploy-rest.md).

## Troubleshoot with REST API
1. Deploy your resources with the [Create a template deployment](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn790564.aspx) operation. To retain information that may be helpful for debugging, set the **debugSetting** 
   property in JSON request to **requestContent** and/or **responseContent**. 
   
        PUT https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourcegroups/{resource-group-name}/providers/microsoft.resources/deployments/{deployment-name}?api-version={api-version}
          <common headers>
          {
            "properties": {
              "templateLink": {
                "uri": "http://mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/templates/template.json",
                "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
              },
              "mode": "Incremental",
              "parametersLink": {
                "uri": "http://mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/templates/parameters.json",
                "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",      
              },
              "debugSetting": {
                "detailLevel": "requestContent, responseContent"
              }
            }
          }
   
    By default, the **debugSetting** value is set to **none**. When specifying the **debugSetting** value, carefully consider the type of information you are passing in during deployment. By logging information about the request or response, you could potentially expose sensitive data that is retrieved through the deployment operations. 
2. Get information about a deployment with the [Get information about a template deployment](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn790565.aspx) operation.
   
        GET https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourcegroups/{resource-group-name}/providers/microsoft.resources/deployments/{deployment-name}?api-version={api-version}
   
    In the response, note in particular the **provisioningState** , **correlationId** and **error** elements. The **correlationId** is used to track related events, and can be helpful 
    when working with technical support to troubleshoot an issue.
   
        { 
          ...
          "properties": {
            "provisioningState":"Failed",
            "correlationId":"d5062e45-6e9f-4fd3-a0a0-6b2c56b15757",
            ...
            "error":{
              "code":"DeploymentFailed","message":"At least one resource deployment operation failed. Please list deployment operations for details. Please see http://aka.ms/arm-debug for usage details.",
              "details":[{"code":"Conflict","message":"{\r\n  \"error\": {\r\n    \"message\": \"Conflict\",\r\n    \"code\": \"Conflict\"\r\n  }\r\n}"}]
            }  
          }
        }
3. Get information about deployment operations with the [List all template deployment operations](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn790518.aspx) operation. 
   
        GET https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourcegroups/{resource-group-name}/providers/microsoft.resources/deployments/{deployment-name}/operations?$skiptoken={skiptoken}&api-version={api-version}
   
    The response will include request and/or response information based on what you specified in the **debugSetting** property during deployment.
   
        {
          ...
          "properties": 
          {
            ...
            "request":{
              "content":{
                "location":"West US",
                "properties":{
                  "accountType": "Standard_LRS"
                }
              }
            },
            "response":{
              "content":{
                "error":{
                  "message":"Conflict","code":"Conflict"
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
4. Get events from the audit logs for the deployment with the [List the management events in a subscription](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn931934.aspx) operation.
   
        GET https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/providers/microsoft.insights/eventtypes/management/values?api-version={api-version}&$filter={filter-expression}&$select={comma-separated-property-names}
