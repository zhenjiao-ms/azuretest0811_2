This article walks you through the process of creating records and records sets by using CLI. After creating your DNS zone, you need to add the DNS records for your domain. To do this, you first need to understand DNS records and record sets.

[!INCLUDE [dns-about-records-include](../../includes/dns-about-records-include.md)]

## Create a record set and record
In this section, we'll show you how to create a record set and records. In this example, you'll create a record set that has the relative name "www" in the DNS zone "contoso.com". The fully-qualified name of the records is "www.contoso.com". The record type is "A", and the time to live (TTL) is 60 seconds. After completing this step, you will have created an empty record set.

To create a record set in the apex of the zone (in this case, "contoso.com"), use the record name "@", including the quotation marks. This is a common DNS convention.

### 1. Create a record set
To create record set, use `azure network dns record-set create`. Specify the resource group, zone name, record set relative name, the record type, and the TTL. If the `--ttl` parameter is not defined, the value defaults to four (in seconds). After completing this step, you will have an empty "www" record set.

*Usage: network dns record-set create <resource-group> <dns-zone-name> <name> <type> <ttl>*

    azure network dns record-set create myresourcegroup  contoso.com  www A  60

### 2. Add records
To use the newly created "www" record set, you need to add records to it. You add records to record sets by using `azure network dns record-set add-record`.

The parameters for adding records to a record set vary depending on the type of the record set. For example, when using a record set of type "A", you will only be able to specify records with the parameter `-a <IPv4 address>`.

You can add IPv4 *A* records to the "www" record set by using the following command:

*Usage: network dns record-set add-record <resource-group> <dns-zone-name> <record-set-name> <type>*

    azure network dns record-set add-record myresourcegroup contoso.com  www A  -a 134.170.185.46

## Additional record type examples
The following examples show how to create a record set of each record type. Each record set contains a single record.
