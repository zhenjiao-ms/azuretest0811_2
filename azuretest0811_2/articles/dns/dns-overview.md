# Azure DNS Overview
The Domain Name System, or DNS, is responsible for translating (or resolving) a website or service name to its IP address. Azure DNS is a hosting service for DNS domains, providing name resolution using Microsoft Azure infrastructure. By hosting your domains in Azure, you can manage your DNS records using the same credentials, APIs, tools, and billing as your other Azure services.

DNS domains in Azure DNS are hosted on Azureâ€™s global network of DNS name servers. We use Anycast networking so that each DNS query is answered by the closest available DNS server. This provides both fast performance and high availability for your domain. 

The Azure DNS service is based on Azure Resource Manager (ARM). As such, it benefits from ARM features such as role-based access control, audit logs, and resource locking. Your domains and records can be managed via the Azure portal, Azure PowerShell cmdlets, and the cross-platform Azure CLI. Applications requiring automatic DNS management can integrate with the service via the REST API and SDKs.

Azure DNS does not currently support purchasing of domain names. If you want to purchase domains, you'll need to use a third-party domain name registrar. The registrar will typically charge a small annual fee. The domains can then be hosted in Azure DNS for management of DNS records. See [Delegate a Domain to Azure DNS](dns-domain-delegation.md) for details.
