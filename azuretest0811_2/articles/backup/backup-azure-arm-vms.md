# Back up Azure VMs to a Recovery Services vault

This article provides the procedure for backing up Azure VMs (both Resource Manager-deployed and Classic-deployed) to a Recovery Services vault. The majority of work for backing up VMs goes into the preparation. Before you can back up or protect a VM, you must complete the [prerequisites](backup-azure-arm-vms-prepare.md) to prepare your environment for protecting your VMs. Once you have completed the prerequisites, then you can initiate the back up operation to take snapshots of your VM.

> [!NOTE]
> Azure has two deployment models for creating and working with resources: [Resource Manager and Classic](../resource-manager-deployment-model.md). You can protect Resource Manager-deployed VMs and Classic VMs with Recovery Services vaults. See [Back up Azure virtual machines](backup-azure-vms.md) for details on working with Classic deployment model VMs.

For additional information, see the articles on [planning your VM backup infrastructure in Azure](backup-azure-vms-introduction.md) and [Azure virtual machines](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/services/virtual-machines/).

## Triggering the back up job
The back up policy associated with the Recovery Services vault, defines how often and when the backup operation runs. By default, the first scheduled backup is the initial backup. Until the initial backup occurs, the Last Backup Status on the **Backup Jobs** blade shows as **Warning(initial backup pending)**.

Unless your initial backup is due to begin very soon, it is recommended that you run **Back up Now**. The following procedure starts from the vault dashboard. This procedure serves for running the initial backup job after you have completed all prerequisites. If the initial backup job has already been run, this procedure is not available. The associated backup policy determines the next backup job.  

To run the initial backup job:

1. On the vault dashboard, on the **Backup** tile, click **Azure Virtual Machines**. <br/>
    ![Settings icon](./media/backup-azure-vms-first-look-arm/rs-vault-in-dashboard-backup-vms.png)
   
    The **Backup Items** blade opens.
2. On the **Backup Items** blade, right-click the vault you want to back up, and click **Backup now**.
   
    ![Settings icon](./media/backup-azure-vms-first-look-arm/back-up-now.png)
   
    The Backup job is triggered. <br/>

3. To view that your initial backup has completed, on the vault dashboard, on the **Backup Jobs** tile, click **Azure virtual machines**.
   
    ![Backup Jobs tile](./media/backup-azure-vms-first-look-arm/open-backup-jobs.png)
   
    The Backup Jobs blade opens.
4. In the **Backup jobs** blade, you can see the status of all jobs.

   > [!NOTE]
   > As a part of the backup operation, the Azure Backup service issues a command to the backup extension in each virtual machine to flush all writes and take a consistent snapshot.
   > 
   > 
   
    When the backup job is finished, the status is *Completed*.
