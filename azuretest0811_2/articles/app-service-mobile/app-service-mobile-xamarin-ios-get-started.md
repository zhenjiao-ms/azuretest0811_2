# Create a Xamarin.iOS app
[!INCLUDE [app-service-mobile-selector-get-started](../../includes/app-service-mobile-selector-get-started.md)]

## Overview
This tutorial shows you how to add a cloud-based backend service to a Xamarin.iOS mobile app by using an Azure mobile app backend.  You will create both a new mobile app backend and a simple *Todo list* Xamarin.iOS app that stores app data in Azure.

Completing this tutorial is a prerequisite for all other Xamarin.iOS tutorials about using the Mobile Apps feature in Azure App Service.

## Prerequisites
To complete this tutorial, you need the following:

* An active Azure account. If you don't have an account, you can sign up for an Azure trial and get up to 10 free mobile apps that you can keep using even after your trial ends. For details, see [Azure Free Trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).
* Visual Studio with Xamarin. See [Setup and install for Visual Studio and Xamarin](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt613162.aspx) for instructions.
* A Mac with Xcode v7.0 or later and Xamarin Studio Community installed. See [Setup and install for Visual Studio and Xamarin](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt613162.aspx) and [Setup, install, and verifications for Mac users](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt488770.aspx) (MSDN).

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to get started with Azure App Service before you sign up for an Azure account, go to [Try App Service](https://tryappservice.azure.com/?appServiceName=mobile). There, you can immediately create a short-lived starter mobile app in App Serviceâ€”no credit card required, and no commitments.

## Create a new Azure Mobile App backend
Follow these steps to create a new Mobile App backend.

[!INCLUDE [app-service-mobile-dotnet-backend-create-new-service](../../includes/app-service-mobile-dotnet-backend-create-new-service.md)]

## Configure the server project
You have now provisioned an Azure Mobile App backend that can be used by your mobile client applications. Next, you will download a server project for a simple "todo list" backend and publish it to Azure.

Follow the steps below to configure the server project to use either the Node.js or .NET backend.

[!INCLUDE [app-service-mobile-configure-new-backend](../../includes/app-service-mobile-configure-new-backend.md)]

## Download and run the Xamarin.iOS app
1. Open the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) in a browser window.
2. On the settings blade for your Mobile App, click **Get Started** > **Xamarin.iOS**. Under step 3, click  **Create a new app** if it's not already selected.  Next click the **Download** button.
   
      This downloads a project that contains a client application that is connected to your mobile app. Save the compressed project file to your local computer, and make a note of where you save it.
3. Extract the project that you downloaded, and then open it in Xamarin Studio (or Visual Studio).

4. Press the F5 key to build the project and start the app in the iPhone emulator.
5. In the app, type meaningful text, such as *Learn Xamarin*, and then click the **+** button.

    This sends a POST request to the new mobile app backend hosted in Azure. Data from the request is inserted into the TodoItem table. Items stored in the table are returned by the mobile app backend, and the data is displayed in the list.

> [!NOTE]
> You can review the code that accesses your mobile app backend to query and insert data in the QSTodoService.cs C# file.
