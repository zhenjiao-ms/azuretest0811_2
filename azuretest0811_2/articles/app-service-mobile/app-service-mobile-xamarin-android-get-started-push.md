# Add push notifications to your Xamarin.Android app
[!INCLUDE [app-service-mobile-selector-get-started-push](../../includes/app-service-mobile-selector-get-started-push.md)]

## Overview
In this tutorial, you add push notifications to the [Create a Xamarin.Android app](app-service-mobile-xamarin-android-get-started.md) project so that every time a record is inserted, a push notification is sent. This tutorial is based on the [Create a Xamarin.Android app](app-service-mobile-xamarin-android-get-started.md) tutorial, which you must complete first. If you do not use the downloaded quick start server project, you must add the push notification extension package to your project. For more information about server extension packages, see [Work with the .NET backend server SDK for Azure Mobile Apps](app-service-mobile-dotnet-backend-how-to-use-server-sdk.md).

## Prerequisites
This tutorial requires the following:

* An active Google account. You can sign up for a Google account at [accounts.google.com](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=268302).
* [Google Cloud Messaging Client Component](http://components.xamarin.com/view/GCMClient/). You will add this component during the tutorial.

## <a name="test"></a>Test push notifications in your app
You can test the app by using a virtual device in the emulator. There are additional configuration steps required when running on an emulator.

1. Make sure that you are deploying to or debugging on a virtual device that has Google APIs set as the target, as shown below in the Android Virtual Device (AVD) manager.
