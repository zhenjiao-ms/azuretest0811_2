# How to Use Apache Cordova Client Library for Azure Mobile Apps
[!INCLUDE [app-service-mobile-selector-client-library](../../includes/app-service-mobile-selector-client-library.md)]

This guide teaches you to perform common scenarios using the latest [Apache Cordova Plugin for Azure Mobile Apps](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cordova-plugin-ms-azure-mobile-apps). If you are new to Azure Mobile
Apps, first complete [Azure Mobile Apps Quick Start](app-service-mobile-cordova-get-started.md) to create a backend, create a table, and download a pre-built Apache Cordova project. In this
guide, we focus on the client-side Apache Cordova Plugin.

## <a name="Setup"></a>Setup and Prerequisites
This guide assumes that you have created a backend with a table. This guide assumes that the table has the same schema as the tables in those
tutorials. This guide also assumes that you have added the Apache Cordova Plugin to your code.  If you have not done so, you may add the Apache
Cordova plugin to your project on the command-line:

```
cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-ms-azure-mobile-apps
```

For more information on creating [your first Apache Cordova app](http://cordova.apache.org/#getstarted), see their documentation.

## <a name="auth"></a>How to: Authenticate Users
Azure App Service supports authenticating and authorizing app users using a variety of external identity
providers: Facebook, Google, Microsoft Account, and Twitter.   You can set permissions on tables to restrict
access for specific operations to only authenticated users. You can also use the identity of authenticated
users to implement authorization rules in server scripts. For more information, see the [Get started with authentication](app-service-mobile-cordova-get-started-users.md) tutorial.

When using authentication in an Apache Cordova app, the following Cordova plugins must be available:

* [cordova-plugin-device](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cordova-plugin-device)
* [cordova-plugin-inappbrowser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cordova-plugin-inappbrowser)

Two authentication flows are supported: a server flow and a client flow.  The server flow provides the simplest
authentication experience, as it relies on the provider's web authentication interface. The client flow allows
for deeper integration with device-specific capabilities such as single-sign-on as it relies on provider-specific
device-specific SDKs.

### <a name="configure-external-redirect-urls"></a>How to: Configure your Mobile App Service for External Redirect URLs.
Several types of Apache Cordova applications use a loopback capability to handle OAuth UI flows.  This causes problems
since the authentication service only knows how to utilize your service by default.  Examples of this are using the Ripple
emulator, running your service locally or in a different Azure App Service but redirecting to the Azure App Service for
authentication, or Live Reload with Ionic.  Follow these instructions to add your local settings to the configuration:

1. Log into the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)
2. Select **All resources** or **App Services** then click on the name of your Mobile App.
3. Click on **Tools**
4. Click on **Resource explorer** in the OBSERVE menu, then click on **Go**.  A new window or tab will open.
5. Expand the **config**, **authsettings** nodes for your site in the left hand navigation.
6. Click on **Edit**
7. Look for the "allowedExternalRedirectUrls" element.  It will be set to null.  Change it to the following:
   
         "allowedExternalRedirectUrls": [
             "http://localhost:3000",
             "https://localhost:3000"
         ],
   
    Replace the URLs with the URLs of your service.  Examples include "http://localhost:3000" (for the Node.js sample
    service), or "http://localhost:4400" (for the Ripple service).  However, these are examples - your situation,
    including for the services mentioned in the examples, may be different.
8. Click on the **Read/Write** button in the top-right corner of the screen.
9. Click on the green **PUT** button.

The settings will be saved at this point.  Do not close the browser window until the settings have finished saving.
You will also need to add these loopback URLs to the CORS settings:

1. Log into the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)
2. Select **All resources** or **App Services** then click on the name of your Mobile App.
3. The Settings blade will open automatically.  If it doesn't, click on **All Settings**.
4. Click on **CORS** under the API menu.
5. Enter the URL that you wish to add in the box provided and press Enter.
6. Enter additional URLs as needed.
7. Click on **Save** to save the settings.

It will take approximately 10-15 seconds for the new settings to take effect.

## <a name="register-for-push"></a>How to: Register for Push Notifications
Install the [phonegap-plugin-push](https://www.npmjs.com/package/phonegap-plugin-push) to handle push notifications.  This can be easily added using the `cordova plugin add`
command on the command line, or via the Git plugin installer within Visual Studio.  The following code in your Apache
Cordova app will register your device for push notifications:

```
var pushOptions = {
    android: {
        senderId: '<from-gcm-console>'
    },
    ios: {
        alert: true,
        badge: true,
        sound: true
    },
    windows: {
    }
};
pushHandler = PushNotification.init(pushOptions);

pushHandler.on('registration', function (data) {
    registrationId = data.registrationId;
    // For cross-platform, you can use the device plugin to determine the device
    // Best is to use device.platform
    var name = 'gcm'; // For android - default
    if (device.platform.toLowerCase() === 'ios')
        name = 'apns';
    if (device.platform.toLowerCase().substring(0, 3) === 'win')
        name = 'wns';
    client.push.register(name, registrationId);
});

pushHandler.on('notification', function (data) {
    // data is an object and is whatever is sent by the PNS - check the format
    // for your particular PNS
});

pushHandler.on('error', function (error) {
    // Handle errors
});
```

Use the Notification Hubs SDK to send push notifications from the server.  You should never
send push notifications directly from clients as that could be used to trigger a denial of
service attack against Notification Hubs or the PNS.
