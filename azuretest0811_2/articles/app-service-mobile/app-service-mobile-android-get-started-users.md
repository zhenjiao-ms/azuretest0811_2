# Add authentication to your Android app
[!INCLUDE [app-service-mobile-selector-get-started-users](../../includes/app-service-mobile-selector-get-started-users.md)]

## Summary
In this tutorial, you add authentication to the todolist quickstart project on Android using a supported identity provider. This tutorial is based on the [Get started with Mobile Apps](app-service-mobile-android-get-started.md) tutorial, which you must complete first.

## <a name="register"></a>Register your app for authentication and configure the App Service
[!INCLUDE [app-service-mobile-register-authentication](../../includes/app-service-mobile-register-authentication.md)]

## <a name="permissions"></a>Restrict permissions to authenticated users
[!INCLUDE [app-service-mobile-restrict-permissions-dotnet-backend](../../includes/app-service-mobile-restrict-permissions-dotnet-backend.md)]

* In Android Studio, open the project that you created when you completed the tutorial [Get started with Mobile Apps](app-service-mobile-android-get-started.md), then from the **Run** menu click **Run app** and verify that an unhandled exception with a status code of 401 (Unauthorized) is raised after the app starts.
  
     This happens because the app attempts to access the backend as an unauthenticated user, but the *TodoItem* table now requires authentication.

Next, you will update the app to authenticate users before requesting resources from the Mobile App backend.

## Add authentication to the app
[!INCLUDE [mobile-android-authenticate-app](../../includes/mobile-android-authenticate-app.md)]

## <a name="cache-tokens"></a>Cache authentication tokens on the client
[!INCLUDE [mobile-android-authenticate-app-with-token](../../includes/mobile-android-authenticate-app-with-token.md)]

## Next steps
Now that you completed this basic authentication tutorial, consider continuing on to one of the following tutorials:

* [Add push notifications to your Android app](app-service-mobile-android-get-started-push.md)
  Learn how to add push notifications support to your app and configure your Mobile App backend to use Azure Notification Hubs to send push notifications.
* [Enable offline sync for your Android app](app-service-mobile-android-get-started-offline-data.md)
  Learn how to add offline support your app using an Mobile App backend. Offline sync allows end-users to interact with a mobile app&mdash;viewing, adding, or modifying data&mdash;even when there is no network connection.
