# How to use the managed client for Azure Mobile Apps
[!INCLUDE [app-service-mobile-selector-client-library](../../includes/app-service-mobile-selector-client-library.md)]

## Overview
This guide shows you how to perform common scenarios using the managed client library for Azure App Service Mobile Apps for Windows and Xamarin apps. If you are new to Mobile Apps, you should consider first completing the [Azure Mobile Apps quickstart](app-service-mobile-windows-store-dotnet-get-started.md) tutorial. In this guide, we focus on the client-side managed SDK. To learn more about the server-side SDKs for Mobile Apps, see the documentation for the [.NET Server SDK](app-service-mobile-dotnet-backend-how-to-use-server-sdk.md) or the [Node.js Server SDK](app-service-mobile-node-backend-how-to-use-server-sdk.md).

## Reference documentation
The reference documentation for the client SDK is located here: [Azure Mobile Apps .NET client reference](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/mt419521\(v=azure.10\).aspx).
You can also find several client samples in the [Azure-Samples GitHub repository](https://github.com/Azure-Samples).

## <a name="setup"></a>Setup and Prerequisites
We assume that you have already created and published your Mobile App backend project, which includes at least one table.  In the code used in this topic, the
table is named `TodoItem` and it will have the following columns: `Id`, `Text`, and `Complete`. This is the same table created when you complete the
[Azure Mobile Apps quickstart](app-service-mobile-windows-store-dotnet-get-started.md).

The corresponding typed client-side type in C# is the following:

    public class TodoItem
    {
        public string Id { get; set; }

        [JsonProperty(PropertyName = "text")]
        public string Text { get; set; }

        [JsonProperty(PropertyName = "complete")]
        public bool Complete { get; set; }
    }

Note that the [JsonPropertyAttribute](http://www.newtonsoft.com/json/help/html/Properties_T_Newtonsoft_Json_JsonPropertyAttribute.htm) is used to define the *PropertyName* mapping between the client type and the table.

To learn how to create new tables in your Mobile Apps backend, see the information in the [.NET Server SDK topic](app-service-mobile-dotnet-backend-how-to-use-server-sdk.md#define-table-controller)
or the [Node.js Server SDK topic](app-service-mobile-node-backend-how-to-use-server-sdk.md#howto-dynamicschema). If you
created your Mobile App backend in the Azure Portal using the QuickStart, you can also use the **Easy tables** setting in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

### How to: Install the managed client SDK package
Use one of the following methods to install the managed client SDK package for Mobile Apps from [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Mobile.Client/):

* **Visual Studio**  
  Right-click your project, click **Manage NuGet Packages**, search for the `Microsoft.Azure.Mobile.Client` package, then click **Install**.
* **Xamarin Studio**  
  Right-click your project, click **Add** > **Add NuGet Packages**, search for the `Microsoft.Azure.Mobile.Client `package, and then click **Add Package**.

In your main activity file, remember to add the following **using** statement:

    using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.MobileServices;

### <a name="symbolsource"></a>How to: Work with debug symbols in Visual Studio
The symbols for the Microsoft.Azure.Mobile namespace are available on [SymbolSource](http://www.symbolsource.org/).  Refer to the [SymbolSource instructions](http://www.symbolsource.org/Public/Wiki/Using)
to integrate SymbolSource with Visual Studio.

## <a name="create-client"></a>Create the Mobile Apps client
The following code creates the [MobileServiceClient](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/microsoft.windowsazure.mobileservices.mobileserviceclient\(v=azure.10\).aspx) object that is used to access your Mobile App backend.

    MobileServiceClient client = new MobileServiceClient("MOBILE_APP_URL");

In the code above, replace `MOBILE_APP_URL` with the URL of the Mobile App backend, which is found in the blade for your Mobile App backend in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
It is normal and recommended that the client instance be a Singleton.

## Work with Tables
The following section details how to search and retrieve records and modify the data within the table.  The following
topics are covered:

* [Create a table reference](#instantiating)
* [Query data](#querying)
* [Filter returned data](#filtering)
* [Sort returned data](#sorting)
* [Return data in pages](#paging)
* [Select specific columns](#selecting)
* [Look up a record by Id](#lookingup)
* [Dealing with untyped queries](#untypedqueries)
* [Inserting data](#inserting)
* [Updating data](#updating)
* [Deleting data](#deleting)
* [Conflict Resolution and Optimistic Concurrency](#optimisticconcurrency)
* [Binding to a Windows User Interface](#binding)
* [Changing the Page Size](#pagesize)

### <a name="instantiating"></a>How to: Create a table reference
All of the code that accesses or modifies data in a backend table calls functions on the `MobileServiceTable` object. You get a reference to the table by calling the
[GetTable](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/jj554275\(v=azure.10\).aspx) method on an instance of the `MobileServiceClient`, as follows:

    IMobileServiceTable<TodoItem> todoTable = client.GetTable<TodoItem>();

This is the typed serialization model. An untyped serialization model is also supported. The following [creates a reference to an untyped table](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/jj554278\(v=azure.10\).aspx):

    // Get an untyped table reference
    IMobileServiceTable untypedTodoTable = client.GetTable("TodoItem");

In untyped queries, you must specify the underlying OData query string.

### <a name="querying"></a>How to: Query data from your Mobile App
This section describes how to issue queries to the Mobile App backend, which includes the following functionality:

* [Filter returned data](#filtering)
* [Sort returned data](#sorting)
* [Return data in pages](#paging)
* [Select specific columns](#selecting)
* [Look up data by ID](#lookingup)

> [!NOTE]
> A server-driven page size is enforced to prevent all rows from being returned. This keeps default requests
> for large data sets from negatively impacting the service.  To return more than 50 rows, use the `Take` method, as
> described in [Return data in pages](#paging).
> 
> 

### <a name="filtering"></a>How to: Filter returned data
The following code illustrates how to filter data by including a `Where` clause in a query. It returns all items from
`todoTable` whose `Complete` property is equal to `false`. The [Where](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn250579\(v=azure.10\).aspx) function applies a row filtering predicate to
the query against the table.

    // This query filters out completed TodoItems and items without a timestamp.
    List<TodoItem> items = await todoTable
       .Where(todoItem => todoItem.Complete == false)
       .ToListAsync();

You can view the URI of the request sent to the backend by using message inspection software, such as browser developer
tools or [Fiddler](http://www.telerik.com/fiddler). If you look at the request URI below, notice that the query string is modified:

    GET /tables/todoitem?$filter=(complete+eq+false) HTTP/1.1

This OData request is translated into an SQL query by the Server SDK that is similar to this:

    SELECT *
    FROM TodoItem
    WHERE ISNULL(complete, 0) = 0

The function which is passed to the `Where` method can have an arbitrary number of conditions. For example, the line below:

    // This query filters out completed TodoItems where Text isn't null
    List<TodoItem> items = await todoTable
       .Where(todoItem => todoItem.Complete == false && todoItem.Text != null)
       .ToListAsync();

Would be translated into an SQL query by the Server SDK that is similar to this:

    SELECT *
    FROM TodoItem
    WHERE ISNULL(complete, 0) = 0
          AND ISNULL(text, 0) = 0

The `WHERE` statement above will find items with `Complete` status set to false with non-null `Text`.

This query can also be split into multiple clauses:

    List<TodoItem> items = await todoTable
       .Where(todoItem => todoItem.Complete == false)
       .Where(todoItem => todoItem.Text != null)
       .ToListAsync();

The two methods are equivalent and may be used interchangeably.  The former option&mdash;of concatenating
multiple predicates in one query&mdash;is more compact and recommended.

The `Where` clause supports operations that be translated into the OData subset. This includes relational
operators (==, !=, <, <=, >, >=), arithmetic operators (+, -, /, *, %),
number precision (Math.Floor, Math.Ceiling), string functions (Length, Substring, Replace, IndexOf, StartsWith,
EndsWith), date properties (Year, Month, Day, Hour, Minute, Second), access properties of an object, and
expressions combining all of these.  When considering what the Server SDK supports, you can consider
the [OData v3 Documentation](http://www.odata.org/documentation/odata-version-3-0/).

### <a name="sorting"></a>How to: Sort returned data
The following code illustrates how to sort data by including an [OrderBy](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn250572\(v=azure.10\).aspx) or [OrderByDescending](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn250568\(v=azure.10\).aspx) function
in the query. It returns items from `todoTable` sorted ascending by the `Text` field.

    // Sort items in ascending order by Text field
    MobileServiceTableQuery<TodoItem> query = todoTable
                    .OrderBy(todoItem => todoItem.Text)
     List<TodoItem> items = await query.ToListAsync();

    // Sort items in descending order by Text field
    MobileServiceTableQuery<TodoItem> query = todoTable
                    .OrderByDescending(todoItem => todoItem.Text)
     List<TodoItem> items = await query.ToListAsync();

### <a name="paging"></a>How to: Return data in pages
By default, the backend returns only the first 50 rows. You can increase the number of returned rows by calling the [Take](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn250574\(v=azure.10\).aspx) method. Use `Take` along with the [Skip](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn250573\(v=azure.10\).aspx) method
to request a specific "page" of the total dataset returned by the query. The following query, when executed, returns the top three items in the table.

    // Define a filtered query that returns the top 3 items.
    MobileServiceTableQuery<TodoItem> query = todoTable
                    .Take(3);
    List<TodoItem> items = await query.ToListAsync();

The following revised query skips the first three results and returns the next three after that. This is effectively the second "page" of data, where the page size is three items.

    // Define a filtered query that skips the top 3 items and returns the next 3 items.
    MobileServiceTableQuery<TodoItem> query = todoTable
                    .Skip(3)
                    .Take(3);
    List<TodoItem> items = await query.ToListAsync();

You can also use the [IncludeTotalCount](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn250560\(v=azure.10\).aspx) method to ensure that the query will get the total count for <i>all</i> the records that would have been returned, ignoring any take
paging/limit clause specified:

    query = query.IncludeTotalCount();

This is a simplified scenario of passing hard-coded paging values to the `Take` and `Skip` methods. In a real-world app, you can use queries similar to the above with a pager
control or comparable UI to let users navigate to previous and next pages.

> [!NOTE]
> To override the 50 row limit in a Mobile App backend, you must also apply the [EnableQueryAttribute](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.web.http.odata.enablequeryattribute.aspx) to the public GET method and specify the paging behavior. When
> applied to the method, the following sets the maximum returned rows to 1000:
> 
> [EnableQuery(MaxTop=1000)]
> 
> 

### <a name="selecting"></a>How to: Select specific columns
You can specify which set of properties to include in the results by adding a [Select](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn250569\(v=azure.10\).aspx) clause to your query. For example, the following code shows how to select just one field
and also how to select and format multiple fields:

    // Select one field -- just the Text
    MobileServiceTableQuery<TodoItem> query = todoTable
                    .Select(todoItem => todoItem.Text);
    List<string> items = await query.ToListAsync();

    // Select multiple fields -- both Complete and Text info
    MobileServiceTableQuery<TodoItem> query = todoTable
                    .Select(todoItem => string.Format("{0} -- {1}",
                        todoItem.Text.PadRight(30), todoItem.Complete ?
                        "Now complete!" : "Incomplete!"));
    List<string> items = await query.ToListAsync();

All the functions described so far are additive, so we can just keep calling them and we'll each time affect more of the query. One more example:

    MobileServiceTableQuery<TodoItem> query = todoTable
                    .Where(todoItem => todoItem.Complete == false)
                    .Select(todoItem => todoItem.Text)
                    .Skip(3).
                    .Take(3);
    List<string> items = await query.ToListAsync();

### <a name="lookingup"></a>How to: Look up data by ID
The [LookupAsync](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/jj871654\(v=azure.10\).aspx) function can be used to look up objects from the database with a particular ID.

    // This query filters out the item with the ID of 37BBF396-11F0-4B39-85C8-B319C729AF6D
    TodoItem item = await todoTable.LookupAsync("37BBF396-11F0-4B39-85C8-B319C729AF6D");

### <a name="untypedqueries"></a>How to: Execute untyped queries
When executing a query using an untyped table object, you must explicitly specify the OData query string by calling [ReadAsync](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/mt691741\(v=azure.10\).aspx), as in the following example:

    // Lookup untyped data using OData
    JToken untypedItems = await untypedTodoTable.ReadAsync("$filter=complete eq 0&$orderby=text");

You get back JSON values that you can use like a property bag. For more information on JToken and Newtonsoft Json.NET, see the [Json.NET](http://www.newtonsoft.com/json) site.

### <a name="inserting"></a>How to: Insert data into a Mobile App backend
All client types must contain a member named **Id**, which is by default a string. This **Id** is required to perform CRUD operations and for offline. The following
code illustrates how to use the [InsertAsync](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn296400\(v=azure.10\).aspx) method to insert new rows into a table. The parameter contains the data to be inserted as a .NET object.

    await todoTable.InsertAsync(todoItem);

If a unique custom ID value is not included in the `todoItem` passed to the `todoTable.InsertAsync` call, a value for ID is generated by the server and is set in
the `todoItem` object returned to the client.

To insert untyped data, you may take advantage of Json.NET as shown below.

    JObject jo = new JObject();
    jo.Add("Text", "Hello World");
    jo.Add("Complete", false);
    var inserted = await table.InsertAsync(jo);

Here is an example using an email address as a unique string id.

    JObject jo = new JObject();
    jo.Add("id", "myemail@emaildomain.com");
    jo.Add("Text", "Hello World");
    jo.Add("Complete", false);
    var inserted = await table.InsertAsync(jo);

### Working with ID values
Mobile Apps supports unique custom string values for the table's **id** column. This allows applications to use custom values such as email addresses or user names for the ID.

String IDs provide you with the following benefits:

* IDs are generated without making a round-trip to the database.
* Records are easier to merge from different tables or databases.
* IDs values can integrate better with an application's logic.

When a string ID value is not set on an inserted record, the Mobile App backend generates a unique value for the ID. You can use the [Guid.NewGuid](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.guid.newguid\(v=vs.110\).aspx) method
to generate your own ID values, either on the client or in the backend.

    JObject jo = new JObject();
    jo.Add("id", Guid.NewGuid().ToString("N"));

### <a name="modifying"></a>How to: Modify data in a Mobile App backend
The following code illustrates how to use the [UpdateAsync](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn250536.\(v=azure.10\)aspx) method to update an existing record with the same ID with new information. The
parameter contains the data to be updated as a .NET object.

    await todoTable.UpdateAsync(todoItem);

To insert untyped data, you may take advantage of [Json.NET](http://www.newtonsoft.com/json) as follows:

    JObject jo = new JObject();
    jo.Add("id", "37BBF396-11F0-4B39-85C8-B319C729AF6D");
    jo.Add("Text", "Hello World");
    jo.Add("Complete", false);
    var inserted = await table.UpdateAsync(jo);

An `id` field must be specified when making an update. This is how the backend identifies which instance to update. The `id` field can be obtained from the
result of the `InsertAsync` call. An `ArgumentException` is raised if you try to update an item without providing the `id` value.

### <a name="deleting"></a>How to: Delete data in a Mobile App backend
The following code illustrates how to use the [DeleteAsync](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn296407\(v=azure.10\).aspx) method to delete an existing instance. The instance is identified by the `id` field set on the `todoItem`.

    await todoTable.DeleteAsync(todoItem);

To delete untyped data, you may take advantage of Json.NET as follows:

    JObject jo = new JObject();
    jo.Add("id", "37BBF396-11F0-4B39-85C8-B319C729AF6D");
    await table.DeleteAsync(jo);

Note that when you make a delete request, an ID must be specified. Other properties are not passed to the service or are ignored at the service. The result of a
`DeleteAsync` call is usually `null`. The ID to pass in can be obtained from the result of the `InsertAsync` call. A `MobileServiceInvalidOperationException` is
thrown when you try to delete an item without specifying the `id` field.

### <a name="optimisticconcurrency"></a>How to: Use Optimistic Concurrency for conflict resolution
Two or more clients may write changes to the same item at the same time. Without any conflict detection, the last write would overwrite any previous updates even
if this was not the desired result. *Optimistic concurrency control* assumes that each transaction can commit and therefore does not use any resource locking. Before
committing a transaction, optimistic concurrency control verifies that no other transaction has modified the data. If the data has been modified, the committing
transaction is rolled back.

Mobile Apps supports optimistic concurrency control by tracking changes to each item using the `version` system property column that is defined for each table
in your Mobile App backend. Each time a record is updated, Mobile Apps sets the `version` property for that record to a new value. During each update request,
the `version` property of the record included with the request is compared to the same property for the record on the server. If the version passed with the
request does not match the backend, then the client library raises a `MobileServicePreconditionFailedException<T>` exception. The type included with the exception
is the record from the backend containing the servers version of the record. The application can then use this information to decide whether to execute the update
request again with the correct `version` value from the backend to commit changes.

Define a column on the table class for the `version` system property to enable optimistic concurrency. for example:

    public class TodoItem
    {
        public string Id { get; set; }

        [JsonProperty(PropertyName = "text")]
        public string Text { get; set; }

        [JsonProperty(PropertyName = "complete")]
        public bool Complete { get; set; }

        // *** Enable Optimistic Concurrency *** //
        [JsonProperty(PropertyName = "version")]
        public string Version { set; get; }
    }


Applications using untyped tables enable optimistic concurrency by setting the `Version` flag on the `SystemProperties` of the table as follows.

    //Enable optimistic concurrency by retrieving version
    todoTable.SystemProperties |= MobileServiceSystemProperties.Version;

In addition to enabling optimistic concurrency, you must also catch the `MobileServicePreconditionFailedException<T>` exception in your code when calling [UpdateAsync](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn250536.\(v=azure.10\)aspx).
Resolve the conflict by applying the correct `version` to the updated record and call [UpdateAsync](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn250536.\(v=azure.10\)aspx) with the resolved record. The following code shows how to resolve
a write conflict once detected:

    private async void UpdateToDoItem(TodoItem item)
    {
        MobileServicePreconditionFailedException<TodoItem> exception = null;

        try
        {
            //update at the remote table
            await todoTable.UpdateAsync(item);
        }
        catch (MobileServicePreconditionFailedException<TodoItem> writeException)
        {
            exception = writeException;
        }

        if (exception != null)
        {
            // Conflict detected, the item has changed since the last query
            // Resolve the conflict between the local and server item
            await ResolveConflict(item, exception.Item);
        }
    }


    private async Task ResolveConflict(TodoItem localItem, TodoItem serverItem)
    {
        //Ask user to choose the resoltion between versions
        MessageDialog msgDialog = new MessageDialog(
            String.Format("Server Text: \"{0}\" \nLocal Text: \"{1}\"\n",
            serverItem.Text, localItem.Text),
            "CONFLICT DETECTED - Select a resolution:");

        UICommand localBtn = new UICommand("Commit Local Text");
        UICommand ServerBtn = new UICommand("Leave Server Text");
        msgDialog.Commands.Add(localBtn);
        msgDialog.Commands.Add(ServerBtn);

        localBtn.Invoked = async (IUICommand command) =>
        {
            // To resolve the conflict, update the version of the item being committed. Otherwise, you will keep
            // catching a MobileServicePreConditionFailedException.
            localItem.Version = serverItem.Version;

            // Updating recursively here just in case another change happened while the user was making a decision
            UpdateToDoItem(localItem);
        };

        ServerBtn.Invoked = async (IUICommand command) =>
        {
            RefreshTodoItems();
        };

        await msgDialog.ShowAsync();
    }

### <a name="binding"></a>How to: Bind Mobile Apps data to a Windows user interface
This section shows how to display returned data objects using UI elements in a Windows app. You can run the following example code to
bind to the source of the list with a query for incomplete items in `todoTable` and display it in a very simple list.  [MobileServiceCollection](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn250636\(v=azure.10\).aspx)
creates a Mobile Apps-aware binding collection.

    // This query filters out completed TodoItems.
    MobileServiceCollection<TodoItem, TodoItem> items = await todoTable
        .Where(todoItem => todoItem.Complete == false)
        .ToCollectionAsync();

    // itemsControl is an IEnumerable that could be bound to a UI list control
    IEnumerable itemsControl  = items;

    // Bind this to a ListBox
    ListBox lb = new ListBox();
    lb.ItemsSource = items;

Some controls in the managed runtime support an interface called [ISupportIncrementalLoading](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/Hh701916.aspx). This interface allows controls to request extra
data when the user scrolls. There is built-in support for this interface for universal Windows apps via [MobileServiceIncrementalLoadingCollection](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn268408\(v=azure.10\).aspx),
which automatically handles the calls from the controls. To use `MobileServiceIncrementalLoadingCollection` in Windows apps, do the following:

    MobileServiceIncrementalLoadingCollection<TodoItem,TodoItem> items;
    items = todoTable.Where(todoItem => todoItem.Complete == false).ToIncrementalLoadingCollection();

    ListBox lb = new ListBox();
    lb.ItemsSource = items;

To use the new collection on Windows Phone 8 and "Silverlight" apps, use the `ToCollection` extension methods on `IMobileServiceTableQuery<T>`
and `IMobileServiceTable<T>`. To actually load data, call `LoadMoreItemsAsync()`.

    MobileServiceCollection<TodoItem, TodoItem> items = todoTable.Where(todoItem => todoItem.Complete==false).ToCollection();
    await items.LoadMoreItemsAsync();

When you use the collection created by calling `ToCollectionAsync` or `ToCollection`, you get a collection which can be bound to UI controls.
This collection is paging-aware, i.e., a control can ask the collection to "load more items", and the collection will do it for the control.
At that point there is no user code involved, the control will start the flow. However, since the collection is loading data from the network,
it's expected that some times this loading will fail. To handle such failures, you may override the `OnException` method on
`MobileServiceIncrementalLoadingCollection` to handle exceptions resulting from calls to `LoadMoreItemsAsync` performed by controls.

Finally, imagine that your table has many fields, but you only want to display some of them in your control. You may use the guidance in the
section "[Select specific columns](#selecting)" above to select specific columns to display in the UI.

### <a name="pagesize"></a>Change the Page size
Azure Mobile Apps returns a maxium of 50 items per request by default.  You can change this by increasing the maximum page size on the server and increasing the requested page size on the lient side.  To increase the requested page size, use an overload of `PullAsync` that lets you specify `PullOptions`:

    PullOptions pullOptions = new PullOptions
        {
            MaxPageSize = 100
        };

Assuming you have made the PageSize equal to or greater than 100 within the server, this will return up to 100 items in each request.

## <a name="#customapi"></a>Work with a custom API
A custom API enables you to define custom endpoints that expose server functionality that does not map to an insert, update, delete, or read operation. By using a
custom API, you can have more control over messaging, including reading and setting HTTP message headers and defining a message body format other than JSON.

You call a custom API by calling one of the [InvokeApiAsync](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn268343\(v=azure.10\).aspx) method overloads on the client. For example, the following line of code sends a POST request to
the **completeAll** API on the backend:

    var result = await client.InvokeApiAsync<MarkAllResult>("completeAll", System.Net.Http.HttpMethod.Post, null);

Note that this a typed method call, which requires that the **MarkAllResult** return type be defined. Both typed and untyped methods are supported.

## <a name="authentication"></a>Authenticate users
Mobile Apps supports authenticating and authorizing app users using a variety of external identity providers: Facebook, Google, Microsoft Account, Twitter, and Azure Active Directory. You can set permissions on tables to restrict access for specific operations to only authenticated users. You can also use the identity of authenticated users to implement authorization rules in server scripts. For more information, see the tutorial
[Add authentication to your app](app-service-mobile-windows-store-dotnet-get-started-users.md).

Two authentication flows are supported: *client managed* and *server managed*  flow. The server flow provides the simplest authentication experience, as it relies on the provider's web authentication interface. The client flow allows for deeper integration with device-specific capabilities as it relies on provider-specific device-specific SDKs.

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend using a client-managed flow in your production apps.
> 
> 

To set-up authentication, you must register your app with one or more identity providers.  The identity provider generates a client ID and a client secret for your app, which are then set in your backend to enable Azure App Service authentication/authorization using that identity provider.  For more information, follow the detailed instructions in the tutorial [Add authentication to your app](app-service-mobile-windows-store-dotnet-get-started-users.md). 

The following topics are covered in this section:

* [Client-managed authentication](#client-flow)
* [Server-managed authentication](#serverflow)
* [Caching the authentication token](#caching)

### <a name="client-flow"></a>Client-managed authentication
Your app can independently contact the identity provider and then provide the returned token during login with your backend. This client flow enables you to provide a single sign-in experience for users or to retrieve additional user data from the identity provider. This may be preferred to using a server flow as it provides a more native UX feel and allows for additional customization.

Examples are provided for the following client-flow authentication patterns:

* [Active Directory Authentication Library](#adal)
* [Facebook or Google](#client-facebook)
* [Live SDK](#client-livesdk)

#### <a name="adal"></a>Authenticate users with the Active Directory Authentication Library
You can use the Active Directory Authentication Library (ADAL) to initiate user authentication from the client using Azure Active Directory authentication. 

1. Configure your mobile app backend for AAD sign-in by following the [How to configure App Service for Active Directory login](app-service-mobile-how-to-configure-active-directory-authentication.md) tutorial. Make sure to complete the optional step of registering a native client application.
2. In Visual Studio or Xamarin Studio, open your project and add a reference to the `Microsoft.IdentityModel.CLients.ActiveDirectory` NuGet package. When searching, include pre-release versions.
3. Add the below code to your application, according to the platform you are using. In each, make the following replacements:
   
   * Replace **INSERT-AUTHORITY-HERE** with the name of the tenant in which you provisioned your application. The format should be
     https://login.windows.net/contoso.onmicrosoft.com. This value can be copied out of the Domain tab in your Azure Active Directory
     in the [Azure Classic portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com/).
   * Replace **INSERT-RESOURCE-ID-HERE** with the client ID for your mobile app backend. You can obtain this from the **Advanced**
     tab under **Azure Active Directory Settings** in the portal.
   * Replace **INSERT-CLIENT-ID-HERE** with the client ID you copied from the native client application.
   * Replace **INSERT-REDIRECT-URI-HERE** with your site's */.auth/login/done* endpoint, using the HTTPS scheme. This value should be
     similar to *https://contoso.azurewebsites.net/.auth/login/done*.
     
     The code needed for each platform follows:
     
     **Windows:**
     
       private MobileServiceUser user;
       private async Task AuthenticateAsync()
       {
     
           string authority = "INSERT-AUTHORITY-HERE";
           string resourceId = "INSERT-RESOURCE-ID-HERE";
           string clientId = "INSERT-CLIENT-ID-HERE";
           string redirectUri = "INSERT-REDIRECT-URI-HERE";
           while (user == null)
           {
               string message;
               try
               {
                   AuthenticationContext ac = new AuthenticationContext(authority);
                   AuthenticationResult ar = await ac.AcquireTokenAsync(resourceId, clientId, 
                       new Uri(redirectUri), new PlatformParameters(PromptBehavior.Auto, false) );
                   JObject payload = new JObject();
                   payload["access_token"] = ar.AccessToken;
                   user = await App.MobileService.LoginAsync(
                       MobileServiceAuthenticationProvider.WindowsAzureActiveDirectory, payload);
                   message = string.Format("You are now logged in - {0}", user.UserId);
               }
               catch (InvalidOperationException)
               {
                   message = "You must log in. Login Required";
               }
               var dialog = new MessageDialog(message);
               dialog.Commands.Add(new UICommand("OK"));

               AuthenticationResult ar = await ac.AcquireTokenAsync(resourceId, clientId, 
                   new Uri(redirectUri), new PlatformParameters(this));
               JObject payload = new JObject();
               payload["access_token"] = ar.AccessToken;
               user = await client.LoginAsync(
                   MobileServiceAuthenticationProvider.WindowsAzureActiveDirectory, payload);
           }
           catch (Exception ex)
           {
               AlertDialog.Builder builder = new AlertDialog.Builder(this);
               builder.SetMessage(ex.Message);
               builder.SetTitle("You must log in. Login Required");
               builder.Create().Show();
           }
       }

           base.OnActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);
           AuthenticationAgentContinuationHelper.SetAuthenticationAgentContinuationEventArgs(requestCode, resultCode, data);
       }

#### <a name="client-facebook"></a>Single sign-in using a token from Facebook or Google
You can use the client flow as shown in this snippet for Facebook or Google.

    var token = new JObject();
    // Replace access_token_value with actual value of your access token obtained
    // using the Facebook or Google SDK.
    token.Add("access_token", "access_token_value");

    private MobileServiceUser user;
    private async System.Threading.Tasks.Task Authenticate()
    {
        while (user == null)
        {
            string message;
            try
            {
                // Change MobileServiceAuthenticationProvider.Facebook
                // to MobileServiceAuthenticationProvider.Google if using Google auth.
                user = await client.LoginAsync(MobileServiceAuthenticationProvider.Facebook, token);
                message = string.Format("You are now logged in - {0}", user.UserId);
            }
            catch (InvalidOperationException)
            {
                message = "You must log in. Login Required";
            }

            var dialog = new MessageDialog(message);
            dialog.Commands.Add(new UICommand("OK"));
            await dialog.ShowAsync();
        }
    }

#### <a name="client-livesdk"></a>Single sign-in using Microsoft Account with the Live SDK
To be able to authenticate users, you must register your app at the Microsoft account Developer Center. You must then connect this registration with your Mobile App backend. Complete the steps in [Register your app to use a Microsoft account login](app-service-mobile-how-to-configure-microsoft-authentication.md) to create a Microsoft account registration and connect it to your Mobile App backend. If you have both Windows Store and Windows Phone 8/Silverlight versions of your app, register the Windows Store version first.

The following code authenticates using Live SDK and uses the returned token to sign-in to your Mobile App backend.

    private LiveConnectSession session;
     //private static string clientId = "<microsoft-account-client-id>";
    private async System.Threading.Tasks.Task AuthenticateAsync()
    {

        // Get the URL the Mobile App backend.
        var serviceUrl = App.MobileService.ApplicationUri.AbsoluteUri;

        // Create the authentication client for Windows Store using the service URL.
        LiveAuthClient liveIdClient = new LiveAuthClient(serviceUrl);
        //// Create the authentication client for Windows Phone using the client ID of the registration.
        //LiveAuthClient liveIdClient = new LiveAuthClient(clientId);

        while (session == null)
        {
            // Request the authentication token from the Live authentication service.
            // The wl.basic scope should always be requested.  Other scopes can be added
            LiveLoginResult result = await liveIdClient.LoginAsync(new string[] { "wl.basic" });
            if (result.Status == LiveConnectSessionStatus.Connected)
            {
                session = result.Session;

                // Get information about the logged-in user.
                LiveConnectClient client = new LiveConnectClient(session);
                LiveOperationResult meResult = await client.GetAsync("me");

                // Use the Microsoft account auth token to sign in to App Service.
                MobileServiceUser loginResult = await App.MobileService
                    .LoginWithMicrosoftAccountAsync(result.Session.AuthenticationToken);

                // Display a personalized sign-in greeting.
                string title = string.Format("Welcome {0}!", meResult.Result["first_name"]);
                var message = string.Format("You are now logged in - {0}", loginResult.UserId);
                var dialog = new MessageDialog(message, title);
                dialog.Commands.Add(new UICommand("OK"));
                await dialog.ShowAsync();
            }
            else
            {
                session = null;
                var dialog = new MessageDialog("You must log in.", "Login Required");
                dialog.Commands.Add(new UICommand("OK"));
                await dialog.ShowAsync();
            }
        }
    }

Refer to the documentation for more information about the [Windows Live SDK](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb404787.aspx).

### <a name="serverflow"></a>Server-managed authentication
Once you have registered your identity provider, call the [LoginAsync](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn296411\(v=azure.10\).aspx) method on the [MobileServiceClient](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/microsoft.windowsazure.mobileservices.mobileserviceclient\(v=azure.10\).aspx) with the [MobileServiceAuthenticationProvider](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windowsazure/microsoft.windowsazure.mobileservices.mobileserviceauthenticationprovider\(v=azure.10\).aspx) value of your provider. For example, the following code initiates a server flow sign-in by using Facebook.

    private MobileServiceUser user;
    private async System.Threading.Tasks.Task Authenticate()
    {
        while (user == null)
        {
            string message;
            try
            {
                user = await client
                    .LoginAsync(MobileServiceAuthenticationProvider.Facebook);
                message =
                    string.Format("You are now logged in - {0}", user.UserId);
            }
            catch (InvalidOperationException)
            {
                message = "You must log in. Login Required";
            }

            var dialog = new MessageDialog(message);
            dialog.Commands.Add(new UICommand("OK"));
            await dialog.ShowAsync();
        }
    }

If you are using an identity provider other than Facebook, change the value of [MobileServiceAuthenticationProvider](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windowsazure/microsoft.windowsazure.mobileservices.mobileserviceauthenticationprovider\(v=azure.10\).aspx) above to the value for your provider.

In a server flow, Azure App Service manages the OAuth 2.0 authentication flow by displaying the sign-in page of the selected provider and generating an App Service authentication token after successful sign-on with the identity provider. The [LoginAsync](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn296411\(v=azure.10\).aspx) method returns a [MobileServiceUser](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windowsazure/microsoft.windowsazure.mobileservices.mobileserviceuser\(v=azure.10\).aspx), which provides both the [UserId](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windowsazure/microsoft.windowsazure.mobileservices.mobileserviceuser.userid\(v=azure.10\).aspx) of the authenticated user and the [MobileServiceAuthenticationToken](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windowsazure/microsoft.windowsazure.mobileservices.mobileserviceuser.mobileserviceauthenticationtoken\(v=azure.10\).aspx), as a JSON web token (JWT). This token can be cached and re-used until it expires. For more information, see [Caching the authentication token](#caching).

### <a name="caching"></a>Caching the authentication token
In some cases, the call to the login method can be avoided after the first successful authentication by storing the authentication token and even the access token from the provider, when using client flow. 

Windows Store and UWP apps can use [PasswordVault](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/windows.security.credentials.passwordvault.aspx) to cache the current authentication token after a successful sign-in, as follows:

    await client.LoginAsync(MobileServiceAuthenticationProvider.Facebook);        

    PasswordVault vault = new PasswordVault();
    vault.Add(new PasswordCredential("Facebook", client.currentUser.UserId, 
        client.currentUser.MobileServiceAuthenticationToken));

The UserId value is stored as the UserName of the credential and the token is the stored as the Password. On subsequent start-ups, you can check the **PasswordVault** for cached credentials. The following example uses cached credentials when they are found, and otherwise attempts to authenticate again with the backend:

    // Try to retrieve stored credentials.
    var creds = vault.FindAllByResource("Facebook").FirstOrDefault();
    if (creds != null)
    {
        // Create the current user from the stored credentials.
        client.currentUser = new MobileServiceUser(creds.UserName);
        client.currentUser.MobileServiceAuthenticationToken = 
            vault.Retrieve("Facebook", creds.UserName).Password;
    }
    else
    {
        // Regular login flow and cache the token as shown above.
    }

When you sign-out a user, you must also remove the stored credential, as follows:

    client.Logout();
    vault.Remove(vault.Retrieve("Facebook", client.currentUser.UserId));

Xamarin    apps use the [Xamarin.Auth](https://components.xamarin.com/view/xamarin.auth/) APIs to securely store credentials in an **Account** object. For an example of using these APIs, see the [AuthStore.cs](https://github.com/azure-appservice-samples/ContosoMoments/blob/dev/src/Mobile/ContosoMoments/Helpers/AuthStore.cs) code file in the [ContosoMoments photo sharing sample](https://github.com/azure-appservice-samples/ContosoMoments/tree/dev).

When you use client-managed authentication, you can also cache the access token obtained from your provider such as Facebook or Twitter. This token can be supplied to request a new authentication token from the backend, as follows:

    var token = new JObject();
    // Replace <your_access_token_value> with actual value of your access token
    token.Add("access_token", "<your_access_token_value>");

    // Authenticate using the access token.
    await client.LoginAsync(MobileServiceAuthenticationProvider.Facebook, token);


## <a name="pushnotifications"></a>Push Notifications
The following topics cover Push Notifications:

* [Register for Push Notifications](#register-for-push)
* [Obtain a Windows Store package SID](#package-sid)
* [Register with Cross-platform templates](#register-xplat)

### <a name="register-for-push"></a>How to: Register for Push Notifications
The Mobile Apps client enables you to register for push notifications with Azure Notification Hubs. When registering, you obtain a handle that you obtain from the
platform-specific Push Notification Service (PNS). You then provide this value along with any tags when you create the registration. The following code registers your
Windows app for push notifications with the Windows Notification Service (WNS):

    private async void InitNotificationsAsync()
    {
        // Request a push notification channel.
        var channel =await PushNotificationChannelManager.CreatePushNotificationChannelForApplicationAsync();

        // Register for notifications using the new channel.
        await MobileService.GetPush().RegisterNativeAsync(channel.Uri, null);
    }

If you are pushing to WNS, then you MUST obtain a Windows Store package SID (see below). Note that in this example, two tags are included with the registration. For more
information on Windows apps, including how to register for template registrations,  see [Add push notifications to your app](app-service-mobile-windows-store-dotnet-get-started-push.md).

Note that requesting tags from the client is not supported.  Tag Requests are silently dropped from registration.  If you wish to register your device with tags,
create a Custom API that uses the Notification Hubs API to perform the registration on your behalf.  [Call the Custom API](#customapi) instead of the
`RegisterNativeAsync()` method.

### <a name="package-sid"></a>How to: Obtain a Windows Store package SID
A package SID is needed for enabling push notifications in Windows Store apps.  The package SID is also used for other things (such as Windows Single Sign-in).  You
need to register your application with the Windows Store in order to receive a package SID.

To obtain this value:

1. In Visual Studio Solution Explorer, right-click the Windows Store app project, click **Store** > **Associate App with the Store...**.
2. In the wizard, click **Next**, sign in with your Microsoft account, type a name for your app in **Reserve a new app name**, then click **Reserve**.
3. After the app registration is successfully created, select the new app name, click **Next**, and then click **Associate**. This adds the required Windows Store registration information to the application manifest.
4. Log into the [Windows Dev Center](https://dev.windows.com/en-us/overview) using your Microsoft Account. Under **My apps**, click the app registration you just created.
5. Click **App management** > **App identity**, and then scroll down to find your **Package SID**.

Many uses of the package SID treat it as a URI, in which case you will need to use *ms-app://* as the scheme. Make note of the version of your package SID formed by concatenating this value as a prefix.

Xamarin apps require some additional code to be able to register an app running on iOS or Android app with the Apple Push Notification Service (APNS) and Google
Cloud Messaging (GCM) services, respectively. For more information see the topic for your platform:

* [Xamarin.Android](app-service-mobile-xamarin-android-get-started-push.md#add-push)
* [Xamarin.iOS](app-service-mobile-xamarin-ios-get-started-push.md#add-push)

### <a name="register-xplat"></a>How to: Register push templates to send cross-platform notifications
To register templates, use the `RegisterAsync()` method with the templates, as follows:

        JObject templates = myTemplates();
        MobileService.GetPush().RegisterAsync(channel.Uri, templates);

Your templates will be of type JObject and can contain multiple templates in the following JSON format:

        public JObject myTemplates()
        {
            // single template for Windows Notification Service toast
            var template = "<toast><visual><binding template=\"ToastText01\"><text id=\"1\">$(message)</text></binding></visual></toast>";

            var templates = new JObject
            {
                ["generic-message"] = new JObject
                {
                    ["body"] = template,
                    ["headers"] = new JObject
                    {
                        ["X-WNS-Type"] = "wns/toast"
                    },
                    ["tags"] = new JArray()
                },
                ["more-templates"] = new JObject {...}
            };
            return templates;
        }

The method **RegisterAsync()** also accepts Secondary Tiles:

        MobileService.GetPush().RegisterAsync(string channelUri, JObject templates, JObject secondaryTiles);

Note that all tags will be stripped away for security. To add tags to installations or templates within installations, see
[Work with the .NET backend server SDK for Azure Mobile Apps](app-service-mobile-dotnet-backend-how-to-use-server-sdk.md).

To send notifications utilizing these registered templates, refer to the [Notification Hubs APIs](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn495101.aspx).

## <a name="misc"></a>Miscellaneous Topics
### <a name="errors"></a>How to: Handle errors
When an error occurs in the backend, the client SDK will raise a `MobileServiceInvalidOperationException`.  The following example shows
how to handle an exception that is returned by the backend:

    private async void InsertTodoItem(TodoItem todoItem)
    {
        // This code inserts a new TodoItem into the database. When the operation completes
        // and App Service has assigned an Id, the item is added to the CollectionView
        try
        {
            await todoTable.InsertAsync(todoItem);
            items.Add(todoItem);
        }
        catch (MobileServiceInvalidOperationException e)
        {
            // Handle error
        }
    }

Another example of dealing with error conditions can be found in the [Mobile Apps Files Sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/app-service-mobile-dotnet-todo-list-files) - the [LoggingHandler](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/app-service-mobile-dotnet-todo-list-files/blob/master/src/client/MobileAppsFilesSample/Helpers/LoggingHandler.cs#L63)
example provides a logging delegate handler (see below) to log the requests being made to the backend.  This provides
an easier way to debug Xamarin applications rather than relying on Fiddler.

### <a name="headers"></a>How to: Customize request headers
To support your specific app scenario, you might need to customize communication with the Mobile App backend. For example, you may want to add a
custom header to every outgoing request or even change responses status codes. You can do this by providing a custom [DelegatingHandler](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.net.http.delegatinghandler\(v=vs.110\).aspx), as in
the following example:

    public async Task CallClientWithHandler()
    {
        HttpResponseMessage[]
        MobileServiceClient client = new MobileServiceClient("AppUrl",
            new MyHandler()
            );
        IMobileServiceTable<TodoItem> todoTable = client.GetTable<TodoItem>();
        var newItem = new TodoItem { Text = "Hello world", Complete = false };
        await todoTable.InsertAsync(newItem);
    }

    public class MyHandler : DelegatingHandler
    {
        protected override async Task<HttpResponseMessage>
            SendAsync(HttpRequestMessage request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
        {
            // Change the request-side here based on the HttpRequestMessage
            request.Headers.Add("x-my-header", "my value");

            // Do the request
            var response = await base.SendAsync(request, cancellationToken);

            // Change the response-side here based on the HttpResponseMessage

            // Return the modified response
            return response;
        }
    }
