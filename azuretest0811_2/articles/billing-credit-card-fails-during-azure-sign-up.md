# My credit card or debit card is declined when I try to sign up for Azure
If your credit card or debit card was declined, it might be because you’re using a virtual or prepaid card. Currently, we honor most credit cards and debit cards, but not those that are virtual or prepaid. The latter are not accepted as valid payment options. The accepted credit card and debit card providers vary based on your country. In the drop-down list for choosing a credit card, you will only see the options that are valid in the country that you selected.

If you are indeed using a valid credit card or debit card, make sure that the card is active and your bank is not blocking online transactions due to its security policies.

[!INCLUDE [support-disclaimer](../includes/support-disclaimer.md)]

## Is your credit/debit card information correct and complete?
* The credit or debit card you’re using should be listed in the drop-down list for the country you choose. If it’s not listed, then it is not an available option for your country.
* The name you enter must exactly match the name printed on the credit/debit card, without any additional symbols/characters.
* The address you enter must exactly match the address that appears on the credit/debit card statement, including street address, city, state, country, and zip/postal code.
* The CVV code you enter must exactly match the code that appears on the back or front of the credit/debit card.

## Are you trying to activate an Azure Free Trial?
The Azure Free Trial offer is limited to one free trial activation per user. If you have already activated a free trial earlier with this credit card or had an Azure subscription in the past that was linked to this credit card, the system will not allow you to activate a free trial now. Instead, use one of the other available Azure plans listed on the [Microsoft Azure Offer Details](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/offer-details/) page.

## Do you want another option to pay besides a credit or debit card?
You can also pay for your Azure subscription via invoicing payment methods such as checks, overnight checks, and wire transfers.

To use the invoice payment option, you must represent a business. This option is not available for individual subscribers. Once your business is set up to pay using the invoice option, you cannot change to a different payment option at a later time.

To start the process of setting up an invoice, see [Azure Billing - How to invoice](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/invoicing/) for details.
