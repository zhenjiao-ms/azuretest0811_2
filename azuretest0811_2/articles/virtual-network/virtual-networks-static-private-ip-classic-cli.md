# How to set a static private IP address (classic) in Azure CLI
[!INCLUDE [virtual-networks-static-private-ip-selectors-classic-include](../../includes/virtual-networks-static-private-ip-selectors-classic-include.md)]

[!INCLUDE [virtual-networks-static-private-ip-intro-include](../../includes/virtual-networks-static-private-ip-intro-include.md)]

[!INCLUDE [azure-arm-classic-important-include](../../includes/azure-arm-classic-important-include.md)] This article covers the classic deployment model. You can also [manage a static private IP address in the Resource Manager deployment model](virtual-networks-static-private-ip-arm-cli.md).

The sample Azure CLI commands below expect a simple environment already created. If you want to run the commands as they are displayed in this document, first build the test environment described in [create a vnet](virtual-networks-create-vnet-classic-cli.md).

## How to specify a static private IP address when creating a VM
To create a new VM named *DNS01* in a new cloud service named *TestService* based on the scenario above, follow these steps:

1. If you have never used Azure CLI, see [Install and Configure the Azure CLI](../xplat-cli-install.md) and follow the instructions up to the point where you select your Azure account and subscription.
2. Run the **azure service create** command to create the cloud service.
   
        azure service create TestService --location uscentral
   
    Expected output:
   
        info:    Executing command service create
        info:    Creating cloud service
        data:    Cloud service name TestService
        info:    service create command OK
3. Run the **azure create vm** command to create the VM. Notice the value for a static private IP address. The list shown after the output explains the parameters used.
   
        azure vm create -l centralus -n DNS01 -w TestVNet -S "192.168.1.101" TestService bd507d3a70934695bc2128e3e5a255ba__RightImage-Windows-2012R2-x64-v14.2 adminuser AdminP@ssw0rd
   
    Expected output:
   
        info:    Executing command vm create
        warn:    --vm-size has not been specified. Defaulting to "Small".
        info:    Looking up image bd507d3a70934695bc2128e3e5a255ba__RightImage-Windows-2012R2-x64-v14.2
        info:    Looking up virtual network
        info:    Looking up cloud service
        warn:    --location option will be ignored
        info:    Getting cloud service properties
        info:    Looking up deployment
        info:    Retrieving storage accounts
        info:    Creating VM
        info:    OK
        info:    vm create command OK
   
   * **-l (or --location)**. Azure region where the VM will be created. For our scenario, *centralus*.
   * **-n (or --vm-name)**. Name of the VM to be created.
   * **-w (or --virtual-network-name)**. Name of the VNet where the VM will be created. 
   * **-S (or --static-ip)**. Static private IP address for the VM.
   * **TestService**. Name of the cloud service where the VM will be created.
   * **bd507d3a70934695bc2128e3e5a255ba__RightImage-Windows-2012R2-x64-v14.2**. Image used to create the VM.
   * **adminuser**. Local administrator for the Windows VM.
   * **AdminP@ssw0rd**. Local administrator password for the Windows VM.

## How to retrieve static private IP address information for a VM
To view the static private IP address information for the VM created with the script above, run the following Azure CLI command and observe the value for *Network StaticIP*:

    azure vm static-ip show DNS01

Expected output:

    info:    Executing command vm static-ip show
    info:    Getting virtual machines
    data:    Network StaticIP "192.168.1.101"
    info:    vm static-ip show command OK

## How to remove a static private IP address from a VM
To remove the static private IP address added to the VM in the script above, run the following Azure CLI command:

    azure vm static-ip remove DNS01

Expected output:

    info:    Executing command vm static-ip remove
    info:    Getting virtual machines
    info:    Reading network configuration
    info:    Updating network configuration
    info:    vm static-ip remove command OK

## How to add a static private IP to an existing VM
To add a static private IP address to the VM created using the script above, runt he following command:

    azure vm static-ip set DNS01 192.168.1.101

Expected output:

    info:    Executing command vm static-ip set
    info:    Getting virtual machines
    info:    Looking up virtual network
    info:    Reading network configuration
    info:    Updating network configuration
    info:    vm static-ip set command OK
