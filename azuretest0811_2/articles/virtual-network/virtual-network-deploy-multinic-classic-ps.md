Currently, you cannot have VMs with a single NIC and VMs with multiple NICs in the same cloud service. Therefore, you need to implement the back end servers in a different cloud service than and all other components in the scenario. The steps below use a cloud service named *IaaSStory* for the main resources, and *IaaSStory-BackEnd* for the back end servers.

## Prerequisites
Before you can deploy the back end servers, you need to deploy the main cloud service with all the necessary resources for this scenario. At minimum, you need to create a virtual network with a subnet for the backend. Visit [Create a virtual network by using PowerShell](virtual-networks-create-vnet-classic-netcfg-ps.md) to learn how to deploy a virtual network.

[!INCLUDE [azure-ps-prerequisites-include.md](../../includes/azure-ps-prerequisites-include.md)]

## Deploy the back end VMs
The backend VMs depend on the creation of the resources listed below.

* **Backend subnet**. The database servers will be part of a separate subnet, to segregate traffic. The script below expects this subnet to exist in a vnet named *WTestVnet*.
* **Storage account for data disks**. For better performance, the data disks on the database servers will use solid state drive (SSD) technology, which requires a premium storage account. Make sure the Azure location you deploy to support premium storage.
* **Availability set**. All database servers will be added to a single availability set, to ensure at least one of the VMs is up and running during maintenance.

### Step 1 - Start your script
You can download the full PowerShell script used [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/master/IaaS-Story/11-MultiNIC/classic/virtual-network-deploy-multinic-classic-ps.ps1). Follow the steps below to change the script to work in your environment.

1. Change the values of the variables below based on your existing resource group deployed above in [Prerequisites](#Prerequisites).
   
        $location              = "West US"
        $vnetName              = "WTestVNet"
        $backendSubnetName     = "BackEnd"
2. Change the values of the variables below based on the values you want to use for your backend deployment.
   
        $backendCSName         = "IaaSStory-Backend"
        $prmStorageAccountName = "iaasstoryprmstorage"
        $avSetName             = "ASDB"
        $vmSize                = "Standard_DS3"
        $diskSize              = 127
        $vmNamePrefix          = "DB"
        $dataDiskSuffix        = "datadisk"
        $ipAddressPrefix       = "192.168.2."
        $numberOfVMs           = 2

### Step 2 - Create necessary resources for your VMs
You need to create a new cloud service, and a storage account for the data disks for all VMs. You also need to specify an image, and a local administrator account for the VMs. To create these resources, execute the following steps.

1. Create a new cloud service.
   
        New-AzureService -ServiceName $backendCSName -Location $location
2. Create a new premium storage account.
   
        New-AzureStorageAccount -StorageAccountName $prmStorageAccountName `
            -Location $location `
            -Type Premium_LRS
3. Set the storage account created above as the current storage account for your subscription.
   
        $subscription = Get-AzureSubscription `
            | where {$_.IsCurrent -eq $true}  
        Set-AzureSubscription -SubscriptionName $subscription.SubscriptionName `
            -CurrentStorageAccountName $prmStorageAccountName
4. Select an image for the VM.
   
        $image = Get-AzureVMImage `
            | where{$_.ImageFamily -eq "SQL Server 2014 RTM Web on Windows Server 2012 R2"} `
            | sort PublishedDate -Descending `
            | select -ExpandProperty ImageName -First 1
5. Set the local administrator account credentials.
   
        $cred = Get-Credential -Message "Enter username and password for local admin account"

### Step 3 - Create VMs
You need to use a loop to create as many VMs as you want, and create the necessary NICs and VMs within the loop. To create the NICs and VMs, execute the following steps.

1. Start a `for` loop to repeat the commands to create a VM and two NICs as many times as necessary, based on the value of the `$numberOfVMs` variable.
   
        for ($suffixNumber = 1; $suffixNumber -le $numberOfVMs; $suffixNumber++){
2. Create a `VMConfig` object specifying the image, size, and availability set for the VM.
   
            $vmName = $vmNamePrefix + $suffixNumber
            $vmConfig = New-AzureVMConfig -Name $vmName `
                            -ImageName $image `
                            -InstanceSize $vmSize `
                            -AvailabilitySetName $avSetName  
3. Provision the VM as a Windows VM.
   
            Add-AzureProvisioningConfig -VM $vmConfig -Windows `
                -AdminUsername $cred.UserName `
                -Password $cred.Password
4. Set the default NIC and assign it a static IP address.
   
            Set-AzureSubnet -SubnetNames $backendSubnetName -VM $vmConfig
            Set-AzureStaticVNetIP -IPAddress ($ipAddressPrefix+$suffixNumber+3) -VM $vmConfig
5. Add a second NIC for each VM.
   
            Add-AzureNetworkInterfaceConfig -Name ("RemoteAccessNIC"+$suffixNumber) `
                -SubnetName $backendSubnetName `
                -StaticVNetIPAddress ($ipAddressPrefix+(53+$suffixNumber)) `
                -VM $vmConfig
6. Create to data disks for each VM.
   
            $dataDisk1Name = $vmName + "-" + $dataDiskSuffix + "-1"    
            Add-AzureDataDisk -CreateNew -VM $vmConfig `
                -DiskSizeInGB $diskSize `
                -DiskLabel $dataDisk1Name `
                -LUN 0       
   
            $dataDisk2Name = $vmName + "-" + $dataDiskSuffix + "-2"   
            Add-AzureDataDisk -CreateNew -VM $vmConfig `
                -DiskSizeInGB $diskSize `
                -DiskLabel $dataDisk2Name `
                -LUN 1
7. Create each VM, and end the loop.
   
            New-AzureVM -VM $vmConfig `
                -ServiceName $backendCSName `
                -Location $location `
                -VNetName $vnetName
        }

### Step 4 - Run the script
Now that you downloaded and changed the script based on your needs, runt he script to create the back end database VMs with multiple NICs.

1. Save your script and run it from the **PowerShell** command prompt, or **PowerShell ISE**. You will see the initial output, as shown below.
   
        OperationDescription    OperationId                          OperationStatus

        New-AzureStorageAccount xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx Succeeded      
   
        WARNING: No deployment found in service: 'IaaSStory-Backend'.
2. Fill out the information needed in the credentials prompt and click **OK**. The output below will be displayed.
