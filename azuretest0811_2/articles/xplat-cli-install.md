# Install the Azure CLI

Quickly install the Azure Command-Line Interface (Azure CLI) to use a set of open-source shell-based commands for creating and managing resources in Microsoft Azure. You have several installation choices: install from an npm package (requires Node.js and npm), use one of the provided installer packages for different operating systems, or install the Azure CLI as a container in a Docker host. For more options and background, see the project repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/azure/azure-xplat-cli).

Once the Azure CLI has been installed, you will be able to [connect it with your Azure subscription](xplat-cli-connect.md) and run the **azure** commands from your command-line interface (Bash, Terminal, Command prompt, and so on) to work with your Azure resources.

## Install an npm package
To install the CLI from an npm package, you'll need the latest Node.js and npm  installed on your system. Then, run the following command to install the Azure CLI package. (On Linux distributions, you might need to use **sudo**  to successfully run the **npm** command.)

    npm install azure-cli -g

> [!NOTE]
> If you need to install or update Node.js and npm for your operating system, see the documentation at [Nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/). We recommend that you install the most recent Node.js LTS version (4.x). If you use an older version, you might get installation errors.

## Use an installer
The following installer packages are also available for download:

* [OS X installer](http://aka.ms/mac-azure-cli)
* [Windows installer](https://www.microsoft.com/web/handlers/webpi.ashx?command=getinstallerredirect&appid=windowsazurexplatcli&mode=new)
* [Linux tar file](http://aka.ms/linux-azure-cli) (requires Node.js and npm) - install by running `sudo npm install -g <path to downloaded tar file>`

## Use a Docker container
In a Docker host, run:

```
docker run -it microsoft/azure-cli
```

## Run Azure CLI commands
Once the Azure CLI has been installed, you will be able to run the **azure** command from your command-line user interface (Bash, Terminal, Command prompt, and so on). For example, to run the help command, type the following:

```
azure help
```
> [!NOTE]
> On some Linux distributions you may receive an error, /usr/bin/env: ‘node’: No such file or directory, this comes from recent installations of nodejs being installed at /usr/bin/nodejs. To fix this error create a symbolic link to /usr/bin/node by running the command below
> 
> 

```
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node
```

To see the version of the Azure CLI you installed, type the following:

```
azure --version
```

Now you are ready! For access to all of the CLI commands to work with your own resources, [connect to your Azure subscription from the Azure CLI](xplat-cli-connect.md).

> [!NOTE]
> When you first use Azure CLI version 0.9.20 or later, you'll see a message asking if you want to allow Microsoft to collect information about how you use the CLI. Participation is voluntary. If you choose to participate, you can stop at any time by running `azure telemetry --disable`. To enable participation at any time, run `azure telemetry --enable`.
>

## Update the CLI
Microsoft frequently releases updated versions of the Azure CLI. Reinstall the CLI using the installer for your operating system or, if you have the latest Node.js and npm installed, update by typing the following (on Linux distributions you might need to use **sudo**).

```
npm update -g azure-cli
```

## Enable tab completion
Tab completion of CLI commands is supported for Mac and Linux.

To enable it in zsh, run:

```
echo '. <(azure --completion)' >> .zshrc
```

To enable it in bash, run:

```
azure --completion >> ~/azure.completion.sh
echo 'source ~/azure.completion.sh' >> ~/.bash_profile
```


## Next steps
* [Connect from the CLI to your Azure subscription](xplat-cli-connect.md) to create and manage Azure resources.
* To learn more about the Azure CLI, download source code, report problems, or contribute to the project, visit the [GitHub repository for the Azure CLI](https://github.com/azure/azure-xplat-cli).
* If you have questions about using the Azure CLI, or Azure, visit the [Azure Forums](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?forum=azurescripting).
* For Linux systems, you can also install the Azure CLI by building it from the [source](http://aka.ms/linux-azure-cli). For more information on building from source, see the INSTALL file included in the source archive.
