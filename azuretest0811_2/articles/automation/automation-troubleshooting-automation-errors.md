# Error handling tips for common Azure Automation errors
This article explains some of the common Azure Automation errors you might experience and suggests possible error handling steps.

## Troubleshoot authentication errors when working with Azure Automation runbooks
### Scenario: Sign in to Azure Account failed
**Error:**
You receive the error "Unknown_user_type: Unknown User Type" when working with the Add-AzureAccount or Login-AzureRmAccount cmdlets.

**Reason for the error:**
This error occurs if the credential asset name is not valid or if the username and password that you used to setup the Automation credential asset are not valid.

**Troubleshooting tips:**
In order to determine what's wrong, take the following steps:  

1. Make sure that you don’t have any special characters, including the **@** character in the Automation credential asset name that you are using to connect to Azure.  
2. Check that you can use the username and password that are stored in the Azure Automation credential in your local PowerShell ISE editor. You can do this by running the following cmdlets in the PowerShell ISE:  
   
        $Cred = Get-Credential  
        #Using Azure Service Management   
        Add-AzureAccount –Credential $Cred  
        #Using Azure Resource Manager  
        Login-AzureRmAccount –Credential $Cred
3. If your authentication fails locally, this means that you haven’t set up your Azure Active Directory credentials properly. Refer to [Authenticating to Azure using Azure Active Directory](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/azure-automation-authenticating-to-azure-using-azure-active-directory/) blog post to get the Azure Active Directory account set up correctly.  

### Scenario: Unable to find the Azure subscription
**Error:**
You receive the error "The subscription named ``<subscription name>`` cannot be found" when working with the Select-AzureSubscription or Select-AzureRmSubscription cmdlets.

**Reason for the error:**
This error occurs if the subscription name is not valid or if the Azure Active Directory user who is trying to get the subscription details is not configured as an admin of the subscription.

**Troubleshooting tips:**
In order to determine if you have properly authenticated to Azure and have access to the subscription you are trying to select, take the following steps:  

1. Make sure that you run the **Add-AzureAccount** before running the **Select-AzureSubscription** cmdlet.  
2. If you still see this error message, modify your code by adding the **Get-AzureSubscription** cmdlet following the **Add-AzureAccount** cmdlet and then execute the code.  Now verify if the output of Get-AzureSubscription contains your subscription details.  
   
   * If you don't see any subscription details in the output, this means that the subscription isn’t initialized yet.  
   * If you do see the subscription details in the output, confirm that you are using the correct subscription name or ID with the **Select-AzureSubscription** cmdlet.   

### Scenario: Authentication to Azure failed because multi-factor authentication is enabled
**Error:**
You receive the error “Add-AzureAccount: AADSTS50079: Strong authentication enrollment (proof-up) is required” when authenticating to Azure with your Azure username and password.

**Reason for the error:**
If you have multi-factor authentication on your Azure account, you can't use an Azure Active Directory user to authenticate to Azure.  Instead, you need to use a certificate or a service principal to authenticate to Azure.

**Troubleshooting tips:**
To use a certificate with the Azure Service Management cmdlets, refer to [creating and adding a certificate to manage Azure services.](http://blogs.technet.com/b/orchestrator/archive/2014/04/11/managing-azure-services-with-the-microsoft-azure-automation-preview-service.aspx) To use a service principal with Azure Resource Manager cmdlets, refer to [creating service principal using Azure portal](../resource-group-create-service-principal-portal.md) and [authenticating a service principal with Azure Resource Manager.](../resource-group-authenticate-service-principal.md)

## Troubleshoot common errors when working with runbooks
### Scenario: Runbook fails because of deserialized object
**Error:**
Your runbook fails with the error "Cannot bind parameter ``<ParameterName>``. Cannot convert the ``<ParameterType>`` value of type Deserialized ``<ParameterType>`` to type ``<ParameterType>``".

**Reason for the error:**
If your runbook is a PowerShell Workflow, it stores complex objects in a deserialized format in order to persist your runbook state if the workflow is suspended.  

**Troubleshooting tips:**  
Any of the following three solutions will fix this problem:

1. If you are piping complex objects from one cmdlet to another, wrap these cmdlets in an InlineScript.  
2. Pass the name or value that you need from the complex object instead of passing the entire object.  
3. Use a PowerShell runbook instead of a PowerShell Workflow runbook.  

### Scenario: Runbook job failed because the allocated quota exceeded
**Error:**
Your runbook job fails with the error "The quota for the monthly total job run time has been reached for this subscription".

**Reason for the error:**
This error occurs when the job execution exceeds the 500-minute free quota for your account. This quota applies to all types of job execution tasks such as testing a job, starting a job from the portal, executing a job by using webhooks and scheduling a job to execute by using either the Azure portal or in your datacenter. To learn more about pricing for Automation see [Automation pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/automation/).

**Troubleshooting tips:**
If you want to use more than 500 minutes of processing per month you will need to change your subscription from the Free tier to the Basic tier. You can upgrade to the Basic tier by taking the following steps:  

1. Sign in to your Azure subscription  
2. Select the Automation account you wish to upgrade  
3. Click on **Settings** > **Pricing tier and Usage** > **Pricing tier**  
4. On the **Choose your pricing tier** blade, select **Basic**    

### Scenario: Cmdlet not recognized when executing a runbook
**Error:**
Your runbook job fails with the error "``<cmdlet name>``: The term ``<cmdlet name>`` is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program."

**Reason for the error:**
This error is caused when the PowerShell engine cannot find the cmdlet you are using in your runbook.  This could be because the module containing the cmdlet is missing from the account, there is a name conflict with a runbook name, or the cmdlet also exists in another module and Automation cannot resolve the name.

**Troubleshooting tips:**
Any of the following solutions will fix the problem:  

* Check that you have entered the cmdlet name correctly.  
* Make sure the cmdlet exists in your Automation account and that there are no conflicts. To verify if the cmdlet is present, open a runbook in edit mode and search for the cmdlet you want to find in the library or run **Get-Command ``<CommandName>``**.  Once you have validated that the cmdlet is available to the account, and that there are no name conflicts with other cmdlets or runbooks, add it to the canvas and ensure that you are using a valid parameter set in your runbook.  
* If you do have a name conflict and the cmdlet is available in two different modules, you can resolve this by using the fully qualified name for the cmdlet. For example, you can use **ModuleName\CmdletName**.  
* If you are executing the runbook on-premises in a hybrid worker group, then make sure that the module/cmdlet is installed on the machine that hosts the hybrid worker.

### Scenario: A long running runbook consistently fails with the exception: "The job cannot continue running because it was repeatedly evicted from the same checkpoint".
**Reason for the error:**
This is by design behavior due to the "Fair Share" monitoring of processes within Azure Automation, which automatically suspends a runbook if it executes longer than 3 hours. However, the error message returned does not provide "what next" options. A runbook can be suspended for a number of reasons. Suspends happen mostly due to errors. For example, an uncaught exception in a runbook, a network failure, or a crash on the Runbook Worker running the runbook, will all cause the runbook to be suspended and start from its last checkpoint when resumed.

**Troubleshooting tips:**
The documented solution to avoid this issue is to use Checkpoints in a workflow.  To learn more refer to [Learning PowerShell Workflows](automation-powershell-workflow.md#Checkpoints).  A more thorough explanation of "Fair Share" and Checkpoint can be found in this blog article [Using Checkpoints in Runbooks](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-automation-reliable-fault-tolerant-runbook-execution-using-checkpoints/).

## Troubleshoot common errors when importing modules
### Scenario: Module fails to import or cmdlets can't be executed after importing
**Error:**
A module fails to import or imports successfully, but no cmdlets are extracted.

**Reason for the error:**
Some common reasons that a module might not successfully import to Azure Automation are:  

* The structure does not match the structure that Automation needs it to be in.  
* The module is dependent on another module that has not been deployed to your Automation account.  
* The module is missing its dependencies in the folder.  
* The **New-AzureRmAutomationModule** cmdlet is being used to upload the module, and you have not given the full storage path or have not loaded the module by using a publicly accessible URL.  

**Troubleshooting tips:**  
Any of the following solutions will fix the problem:  

* Make sure that the module follows the following format:  
  ModuleName.Zip **->** ModuleName or Version Number **->** (ModuleName.psm1, ModuleName.psd1)
* Open the .psd1 file and see if the module has any dependencies.  If it does, upload these modules to the Automation account.  
* Make sure that any referenced .dlls are present in the module folder.  

## Troubleshoot common errors when working with Desired State Configuration (DSC)
### Scenario: Node is in failed status with a “Not found” error
**Error:**
The node has a report with **Failed** status and containing the error "The attempt to get the action from server https://``<url>``//accounts/``<account-id>``/Nodes(AgentId=``<agent-id>``)/GetDscAction failed because a valid configuration ``<guid>`` cannot be found.”

**Reason for the error:**
This error typically occurs when the node is assigned to a configuration name (e.g. ABC) instead of a node configuration name (e.g. ABC.WebServer).  

**Troubleshooting tips:**  

* Make sure that you are assigning the node with "node configuration name" and not the "configuration name".  
* You can assign a node configuration to a node using Azure portal or with a PowerShell cmdlet.
  
  * In order to assign a node configuration to a node using Azure portal, open the **DSC Nodes** blade, then select a node and click on **Assign node configuration** button.  
  * In order to assign a node configuration to a node using PowerShell cmdlet, use **Set-AzureRmAutomationDscNode** cmdlet

### Scenario:  No node configurations (MOF files) were produced when a configuration is compiled
**Error:**
Your DSC compilation job suspends with the error: “Compilation completed successfully, but no node configuration .mofs were generated”.

**Reason for the error:**
When the expression following the **Node** keyword in the DSC configuration evaluates to $null then no node configurations will be produced.    

**Troubleshooting tips:**  
Any of the following solutions will fix the problem:  

* Make sure that the expression next to the **Node** keyword in the configuration definition is not evaluating to $null.  
* If you are passing ConfigurationData when compiling the configuration, make sure that you are passing the expected values that the configuration requires from [ConfigurationData](automation-dsc-compile.md#configurationdata).

### Scenario:  The DSC node report becomes stuck “in progress” state
**Error:**
DSC Agent outputs “No instance found with given property values.”

**Reason for the error:**
You have upgraded your WMF version and have corrupted WMI.  

**Troubleshooting tips:**
Follow the instructions in the [DSC known issues and limitations](https://msdn.microsoft.com/powershell/wmf/limitation_dsc) blog post to fix the issue.

### Scenario:  Unable to use a credential in a DSC configuration
**Error:**
Your DSC compilation job was suspended with the error: “System.InvalidOperationException error processing property 'Credential' of type ``<some resource name>``: Converting and storing an encrypted password as plaintext is allowed only if PSDscAllowPlainTextPassword is set to true”.

**Reason for the error:**
You have used a credential in a configuration but didn’t provide proper **ConfigurationData** to set **PSDscAllowPlainTextPassword** to true for each node configuration.  

**Troubleshooting tips:**  

* Make sure to pass in the proper **ConfigurationData** to set **PSDscAllowPlainTextPassword** to true for each node configuration mentioned in the configuration. For more information, refer to [assets in Azure Automation DSC](automation-dsc-compile.md#assets).
