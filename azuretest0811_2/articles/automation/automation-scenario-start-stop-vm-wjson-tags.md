# Azure Automation scenario: Using JSON-formatted tags to create a schedule for Azure VM startup and shutdown
Customers often want to schedule the startup and shutdown of virtual machines to help reduce subscription costs or support business and technical requirements.  

The following scenario enables you to set up automated startup and shutdown of your VMs by using a tag called Schedule at a resource group level or virtual machine level in Azure. This schedule can be configured from Sunday to Saturday with a startup time and shutdown time.  

We do have some out-of-the-box options. These include:

* [Virtual machine scale sets](../virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-overview.md) with autoscale settings that enable you to scale in or out.
* [DevTest Labs](../devtest-lab/devtest-lab-overview.md) service, which has the built-in capability of scheduling startup and shutdown operations.

However, these options only support specific scenarios and cannot be applied to infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) VMs.   

When the Schedule tag is applied to a resource group, it's also applied to all virtual machines inside that resource group. If a schedule is also directly applied to a VM, the last schedule takes precedence in the following order:

1. Schedule applied to a resource group
2. Schedule applied to a resource group and virtual machine in the resource group
3. Schedule applied to a virtual machine

This scenario essentially takes a JSON string with a specified format and adds it as the value for a tag called Schedule. Then a runbook lists all resource groups and virtual machines and identifies the schedules for each VM based on the scenarios listed earlier. Next it loops through the VMs that have schedules attached and evaluates what action should be taken. For example, it determines which VMs need to be stopped, shut down, or ignored.

These runbooks authenticate by using the [Azure Run As account](automation-sec-configure-azure-runas-account.md).

## Download the runbooks for the scenario
This scenario consists of four PowerShell Workflow runbooks that you can download from the [TechNet Gallery](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Azure-Automation-Runbooks-84f0efc7) or the [GitHub](https://github.com/paulomarquesdacosta/azure-automation-scheduled-shutdown-and-startup) repository for this project.

| Runbook | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Test-ResourceSchedule |Checks each virtual machine schedule and performs shutdown or startup depending on the schedule. |
| Add-ResourceSchedule |Adds the Schedule tag to a VM or resource group. |
| Update-ResourceSchedule |Modifies the existing Schedule tag by replacing it with a new one. |
| Remove-ResourceSchedule |Removes the Schedule tag from a VM or resource group. |

## Install and configure this scenario
### Install and publish the runbooks
After downloading the runbooks, you can import them by using the procedure in [Creating or importing a runbook in Azure Automation](automation-creating-importing-runbook.md#importing-a-runbook-from-a-file-into-Azure-Automation).  Publish each runbook after it has been successfully imported into your Automation account.

### Add a schedule to the Test-ResourceSchedule runbook
Follow these steps to enable the schedule for the Test-ResourceSchedule runbook. This is the runbook that verifies which virtual machines should be started, shut down, or left as is.

1. From the Azure portal, open your Automation account, and then click the **Runbooks** tile.
2. On the **Test-ResourceSchedule** blade, click the **Schedules** tile.
3. On the **Schedules** blade, click **Add a schedule**.
4. On the **Schedules** blade, select **Link a schedule to your runbook**. Then select **Create a new schedule**.
5. On the **New schedule** blade, type in the name of this schedule, for example: *HourlyExecution*.
6. For the schedule **Start**, set the start time to an hour increment.
7. Select **Recurrence**, and then for **Recur every interval**, select **1 hour**.
8. Verify that **Set expiration** is set to **No**, and then click **Create** to save your new schedule.
9. On the **Schedule Runbook** options blade, select **Parameters and run settings**. In the Test-ResourceSchedule **Parameters** blade, enter the name of your subscription in the **SubscriptionName** field.  This is the only parameter that's required for the runbook.  When you're finished, click **OK**.  

The runbook schedule should look like the following when it's completed:

## Format the JSON string
This solution basically takes a JSON string with a specified format and adds it as the value for a tag called Schedule. Then a runbook lists all resource groups and virtual machines and identifies the schedules for each virtual machine.

The runbook loops over the virtual machines that have schedules attached and checks what actions should be taken. The following is an example of how the solutions should be formatted:

    {
       "TzId": "Eastern Standard Time",
        "0": {  
           "S": "11",
           "E": "17"
        },
        "1": {
           "S": "9",
           "E": "19"
        },
        "2": {
           "S": "9",
           "E": "19"
        },
    }

Here is some detailed information about this structure:

1. The format of this JSON structure is optimized to work around the 256-character limitation of a single tag value in Azure.
2. *TzId* represents the time zone of the virtual machine. This ID can be obtained by using the TimeZoneInfo .NET class in a PowerShell session--**[System.TimeZoneInfo]::GetSystemTimeZones()**.
   
    ![GetSystemTimeZones in PowerShell](./media/automation-scenario-start-stop-vm-wjson-tags/automation-get-timzone-powershell.png)
   
   * Weekdays are represented with a numeric value of zero to six. The value zero equals Sunday.
   * The start time is represented with the **S** attribute, and its value is in a 24-hour format.
   * The end or shutdown time is represented with the **E** attribute, and its value is in a 24-hour format.
     
     If the **S** and **E** attributes each have a value of zero (0), the virtual machine will be left in its present state at the time of evaluation.   
3. If you want to skip evaluation for a specific day of the week, donâ€™t add a section for that day of the week. In the following example, only Monday is evaluated, and the other days of the week are ignored:
   
        {
          "TzId": "Eastern Standard Time",
           "1": {
             "S": "11",
             "E": "17"
           }
        }

## Tag resource groups or VMs
To shut down VMs, you need to tag either the VMs or the resource groups in which they're located. Virtual machines that don't have a Schedule tag are not evaluated. Therefore, they aren't started or shut down.

There are two ways to tag resource groups or VMs with this solution. You can do it directly from the portal. Or you can use the Add-ResourceSchedule, Update-ResourceSchedule, and Remove-ResourceSchedule runbooks.

### Tag through the portal
Follow these steps to tag a virtual machine or resource group in the portal:

1. Flatten the JSON string and verify that there aren't any spaces.  Your JSON string should look like this:
   
        {"TzId":"Eastern Standard Time","0":{"S":"11","E":"17"},"1":{"S":"9","E":"19"},"2": {"S":"9","E":"19"},"3":{"S":"9","E":"19"},"4":{"S":"9","E":"19"},"5":{"S":"9","E":"19"},"6":{"S":"11","E":"17"}}
2. Select the **Tag** icon for a VM or resource group to apply this schedule.

![VM tag option](./media/automation-scenario-start-stop-vm-wjson-tags/automation-vm-tag-option.png)    

1. Tags are defined following a key/value pair. Type **Schedule** in the **Key** field, and then paste the JSON string into the **Value** field. Click **Save**. Your new tag should now appear in the list of tags for your resource.

### Tag from PowerShell
All imported runbooks contain help information at the beginning of the script that describes how to execute the runbooks directly from PowerShell. You can call the Add-ScheduleResource and Update-ScheduleResource runbooks from PowerShell. You do this by passing required parameters that enable you to create or update the Schedule tag on a VM or resource group outside of the portal.  

To create, add, and delete tags through PowerShell, you first need to [set up your PowerShell environment for Azure](../powershell-install-configure.md). After you complete the setup, you can proceed with the following steps.

### Create a schedule tag with PowerShell
1. Open a PowerShell session. Then use the following example to authenticate with your Run As account and to specify a subscription:   
   
        Conn = Get-AutomationConnection -Name AzureRunAsConnection
        Add-AzureRMAccount -ServicePrincipal -Tenant $Conn.TenantID `
        -ApplicationId $Conn.ApplicationID -CertificateThumbprint $Conn.CertificateThumbprint
        Select-AzureRmSubscription -SubscriptionName "MySubscription"
2. Define a schedule hash table. Here is an example of how it should be constructed:
   
        $schedule= @{ "TzId"="Eastern Standard Time"; "0"= @{"S"="11";"E"="17"};"1"= @{"S"="9";"E"="19"};"2"= @{"S"="9";"E"="19"};"3"= @{"S"="9";"E"="19"};"4"= @{"S"="9";"E"="19"};"5"= @{"S"="9";"E"="19"};"6"= @{"S"="11";"E"="17"}}
3. Define the parameters that are required by the runbook. In the following example, we are targeting a VM:
   
        $params = @{"SubscriptionName"="MySubscription";"ResourceGroupName"="ResourceGroup01"; `
        "VmName"="VM01";"Schedule"=$schedule}
   
    If youâ€™re tagging a resource group, remove the *VMName* parameter from the $params hash table as follows:
   
        $params = @{"SubscriptionName"="MySubscription";"ResourceGroupName"="ResourceGroup01"; `
        "Schedule"=$schedule}
4. Run the Add-ResourceSchedule runbook with the following parameters to create the Schedule tag:
   
        Start-AzureRmAutomationRunbook -Name "Add-ResourceSchedule" -Parameters $params `
        -AutomationAccountName "AutomationAccount" -ResourceGroupName "ResourceGroup01"
5. To update a resource group or virtual machine tag, execute the **Update-ResourceSchedule** runbook with the following parameters:
   
        Start-AzureRmAutomationRunbook -Name "Update-ResourceSchedule" -Parameters $params `
        -AutomationAccountName "AutomationAccount" -ResourceGroupName "ResourceGroup01"

### Remove a schedule tag with PowerShell
1. Open a PowerShell session and run the following to authenticate with your Run As account and to select and specify a subscription:
   
        Conn = Get-AutomationConnection -Name AzureRunAsConnection
        Add-AzureRMAccount -ServicePrincipal -Tenant $Conn.TenantID `
        -ApplicationId $Conn.ApplicationID -CertificateThumbprint $Conn.CertificateThumbprint
        Select-AzureRmSubscription -SubscriptionName "MySubscription"
2. Define the parameters that are required by the runbook. In the following example, we are targeting a VM:
   
        $params = @{"SubscriptionName"="MySubscription";"ResourceGroupName"="ResourceGroup01" `
        ;"VmName"="VM01"}
   
    If youâ€™re removing a tag from a resource group, remove the *VMName* parameter from the $params hash table as follows:
   
        $params = @{"SubscriptionName"="MySubscription";"ResourceGroupName"="ResourceGroup01"}
3. Execute the Remove-ResourceSchedule runbook to remove the Schedule tag:
   
        Start-AzureRmAutomationRunbook -Name "Remove-ResourceSchedule" -Parameters $params `
        -AutomationAccountName "AutomationAccount" -ResourceGroupName "ResourceGroup01"
4. To update a resource group or virtual machine tag, execute the Remove-ResourceSchedule runbook with the following parameters:
   
        Start-AzureRmAutomationRunbook -Name "Remove-ResourceSchedule" -Parameters $params `
        -AutomationAccountName "AutomationAccount" -ResourceGroupName "ResourceGroup01"

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend that you proactively monitor these runbooks (and the virtual machine states) to verify that your virtual machines are being shut down and started accordingly.
