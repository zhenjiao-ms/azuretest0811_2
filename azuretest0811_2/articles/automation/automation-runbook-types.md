# Azure Automation runbook types
Azure Automation supports four types of runbooks that are  briefly described in the following table.  The sections below provide further information about each type including considerations on when to use each.

| Type | Description |
|:--- |:--- |
| [Graphical](#graphical-runbooks) |Based on Windows PowerShell and created and edited completely in graphical editor in Azure portal. |
| [Graphical PowerShell Workflow](#graphical-runbooks) |Based on Windows PowerShell Workflow and created and edited completely in the graphical editor in Azure portal.  |
| [PowerShell](#powershell-runbooks) |Text runbook based on Windows PowerShell script. |
| [PowerShell Workflow](#powershell-workflow-runbooks) |Text runbook based on Windows PowerShell Workflow. |

## Graphical runbooks
[Graphical](automation-runbook-types.md#graphical-runbooks) and Graphical PowerShell Workflow runbooks are created and edited with the graphical editor in the Azure portal.  You can export them to a file and then import them into another automation account, but you cannot create or edit them with another tool.  Graphical runbooks generate PowerShell code, but you can't directly view or modify the code. Graphical runbooks cannot be converted to one of the [text formats](automation-runbook-types.md), nor can a text runbook be converted to graphical format. Graphical runbooks can be converted to Graphical PowerShell Workflow runbooks during import and vice-versa.

### Advantages
* Create runbooks with minimal knowledge of [PowerShell](automation-powershell-workflow.md).
* Visually represent management processes.
* Include other runbooks as child runbooks to create high level workflows.

### Limitations
* Can't edit runbook outside of Azure portal.
* May require a Code activity containing PowerShell code to perform complex logic.
* Can't view or directly edit the PowerShell code that is created by the graphical workflow. Note that you can view the code you create in any Code activities.

## PowerShell runbooks
PowerShell runbooks are based on Windows PowerShell.  You directly edit the code of the runbook using the text editor in the Azure portal.  You can also use any offline text editor and [import the runbook](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn643637.aspx) into Azure Automation.

### Advantages
* Implement all complex logic with PowerShell code without the additional complexities of PowerShell Workflow. 
* Runbook starts faster than Graphical or PowerShell Workflow runbooks since it doesn't need to be compiled before running.

### Limitations
* Must be familiar with PowerShell scripting.
* Can't use [parallel processing](automation-powershell-workflow.md#parallel-processing) to perform multiple actions in parallel.
* Can't use [checkpoints](automation-powershell-workflow.md#checkpoints) to resume runbook in case of error.
* PowerShell Workflow runbooks and Graphical runbooks can only be included as child runbooks by using the Start-AzureAutomationRunbook cmdlet which creates a new job.

### Known Issues
Following are current known issues with PowerShell runbooks.

* PowerShell runbooks cannot cannot retrieve an unencrypted [variable asset](automation-variables.md) with a null value.
* PowerShell runbooks cannot retrieve a [variable asset](automation-variables.md) with *~* in the name.
* Get-Process in a loop in a PowerShell runbook may crash after about 80 iterations. 
* A PowerShell runbook may fail if it attempts to write a very large amount of data to the output stream at once.   You can typically work around this issue by outputting just the information you need when working with large objects.  For example, instead of outputting something like *Get-Process*, you can output just the required fields with *Get-Process | Select ProcessName, CPU*.

## PowerShell Workflow runbooks
PowerShell Workflow runbooks are text runbooks based on [Windows PowerShell Workflow](automation-powershell-workflow.md).  You directly edit the code of the runbook using the text editor in the Azure portal.  You can also use any offline text editor and [import the runbook](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn643637.aspx) into Azure Automation.

### Advantages
* Implement all complex logic with PowerShell Workflow code.
* Use [checkpoints](automation-powershell-workflow.md#checkpoints) to resume runbook in case of error.
* Use [parallel processing](automation-powershell-workflow.md#parallel-processing) to perform multiple actions in parallel.
* Can include other Graphical runbooks and PowerShell Workflow runbooks as child runbooks to create high level workflows.

### Limitations
* Author must be familiar with PowerShell Workflow.
* Runbook must deal with the additional complexity of PowerShell Workflow such as [deserialized objects](automation-powershell-workflow.md#code-changes).
* Runbook takes longer to start than PowerShell runbooks since it needs to be compiled before running.
* PowerShell runbooks can only be included as child runbooks by using the Start-AzureAutomationRunbook cmdlet which creates a new job.

## Considerations
You should take into account the following additional considerations when determining which type to use for a particular runbook.

* You can't convert runbooks from graphical to textual type or vice-versa.
* There are limitations using runbooks of different types as a child runbook.  See [Child runbooks in Azure Automation](automation-child-runbooks.md) for more information.
