# Protect SQL Server with SQL Server disaster recovery and Azure Site Recovery
The Azure Site Recovery service contributes to your business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) strategy by orchestrating replication, failover and recovery of virtual machines and physical servers. Machines can be replicated to Azure, or to a secondary on-premises data center. For a quick overview read [What is Azure Site Recovery?](site-recovery-overview.md).

 This article describes how to protect the SQL Server back end of an application using a combination of SQL Server BCDR technologies and Azure Site Recovery. You should have a good understanding of SQL Server disaster recovery capabilities (failover clustering, AlwaysOn availability groups, database mirroring, log shipping) and of Azure Site Recovery, before you deploy the scenarios described in this article.

## Overview
Many workloads use SQL Server as a foundation. Applications such as SharePoint, Dynamics, and SAP use SQL Server to implement data services.  Applications deploy SQL Server in a number of different ways:

* **Standalone SQL Server**: SQL Server and all databases are hosted on a single machine (physical or a virtual). When virtualized, host clustering is used for local high availability. No guest-level high availability is implemented.
* **SQL Server Failover Clustering Instances (Always On FCI)**: Two or more nodes of SQL server instances with shared disks are configured in a Windows Failover cluster. If any of the cluster instances is down, the cluster can fail over SQL Server to another instance. This setup is typically used for HA on a primary site. It doesn't protect against failure or outage in the shared storage layer. Shared disk can be implemented using ISCSI, Fiber channel or Shared VHDx.
* **SQL Always On Availability Groups**: In this setup, two nodes are setup in a shared nothing cluster with SQL Server databases configured in an availability group with synchronous replication and automatic failover.

In Enterprise editions, SQL Server also provides native disaster recovery technologies for recovering databases to a remote site. In this article, we'll leverage and integrate with these native SQL disaster recovery technologies: 

* SQL Always On Availability Groups for disaster recovery for SQL Server 2012 or 2014 Enterprise editions.
* SQL database mirroring in high safety mode for SQL Server Standard edition (any version), or for SQL Server 2008 R2.

Site Recovery can protect SQL Server as summarized in the table.

|  | **On-premises to on-premises** | **On-premises to Azure**  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Hyper-V** |Yes |Yes |
| **VMware** |Yes |Yes  |
| **Physical server** |Yes |Yes |

## Support and integration
These SQL Server versions are supported by the scenarios in this article:

* SQL Server 2014 Enterprise and Standard
* SQL Server 2012 Enterprise and Standard
* SQL Server 2008 R2 Enterprise and Standard

Site Recovery can be integrated with native SQL Server BCDR technologies summarized in the table below to provide a disaster recovery solution.

| **Feature** | **Details** | **SQL Server version**  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **AlwaysOn availability group** |Multiple standalone instances of SQL Server each run in a failover cluster that has multiple nodes.<br/><br/>Databases can be grouped into failover groups that can be copied (mirrored) on SQL Server instances so that no shared storage is needed.<br/><br/>Provides disaster recovery between a primary site and one or more secondary sites. Two nodes can be set up in a shared nothing cluster with SQL Server databases configured in an availability group with synchronous replication and automatic failover. |SQL Server 2014 & 2012 Enterprise edition |
| **Failover clustering (AlwaysOn FCI)** |SQL Server leverages Windows failover clustering for high availability of on-premises SQL Server workloads.<br/><br/>Nodes running instances of SQL Server with shared disks are configured in a failover cluster. If an instance is down the cluster fails over to different one.<br/><br/>The cluster doesn't protect against failure or outages in shared storage. The shared disk can be implemented with iSCSI, fiber channel, or shared VHDXs. |SQL Server Enterprise editions<br/><br/>SQL Server Standard edition (limited to two nodes only) |
| **Database mirroring (high safety mode)** |Protects a single database to a single secondary copy. Available in both high safety (synchronous) and high performance (asynchronous) replication modes. Doesn’t require a failover cluster. |SQL Server 2008 R2<br/><br/>SQL Server Enterprise all editions |
| **Standalone SQL Server** |The SQL Server and database are hosted on a single server (physical or virtual). Host clustering is used for high availability if the server is virtual. No guest-level high availability. |Enterprise or Standard edition |

## Deployment recommendations

## Deployment prerequisites
Here's what you need before you start:

* An on-premises SQL Server deployment running a supported SQL Server version. Typically you'll also need an Active Directory for your SQL server.
* The prerequisites for the scenario you want to deploy. Prerequisites can be found in each deployment article. Links to these are provided in the [Site Recovery Overview](site-recovery-overview.md).
* If you want to set up recovery in Azure, you'll need to run the [Azure Virtual Machine Readiness Assessment](http://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=40898) tool on your SQL Server virtual machines to make sure they're compatible with Azure and Site Recovery.

## Set up Active Directory
You'll need Active Directory on the secondary recovery site for SQL Server to run properly. there are a couple of options:

* **Small enterprise**—If you have a small number of applications and a single domain controller for the on-premises site, and you want to fail over the entire site, we recommend that you use Site Recovery repication to replicate the domain controller to the secondary datacenter or to Azure.
* **Medium to large enterprise**—If you have a large number of application, you're running an Active Directory forest, and you want to fail over by application or workload, we recommend you set up an additional domain controller in the secondary datacenter or in Azure. Note that if you're using AlwaysOn availability groups to recover to a remote site we recommend you set up another additional domain controller on the secondary site or Azure, to use for the recovered SQL Server instance.

The instructions in this document presume that a domain controller is available in the secondary location. [Read more](site-recovery-active-directory.md) about protecting Active Directory with Site Recovery.

## Integrate protection with SQL Server Always-On (on-premises to Azure)
Site Recovery natively supports SQL AlwaysOn. If you've created a SQL Availability Group with an Azure virtual machine set up as ‘Secondary’ then you can use Site Recovery to manage the failover of the Availability Groups. 

> [!NOTE]
> This capability is currently in preview and available when Hyper-V host servers in the primary datacenter are managed in VMM clouds and when VMware setup is managed by a [Configuration Server](site-recovery-vmware-to-azure.md#configuration-server-prerequisites). Right now this capability is not available in the new Azure portal.
> 
> 

#### Prerequisites
Here's what you need to integrate SQL AlwaysOn with Site Recovery:

* An on-premises SQL Server (standalone server or a failover cluster).
* One or more Azure virtual machines with SQL Server installed
* A SQL Availability Group set up between an on-premises SQL Server and SQL Server running in Azure
* PowerShell remoting should be enabled on the on-premises SQL Server machine. The VMM server or the Configuration Server should be able to make remote PowerShell calls to the SQL Server.
* A user account should be added on the on-premises SQL Server, in these SQL user groups with at least these permissions:
  * ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP: permissions [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh231018.aspx), and [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ff878601.aspx#Anchor_3)
  * ALTER DATABASE - permissions[here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ff877956.aspx#Security)
* A RunAs account should be created on VMM Server or an account should be created on the Configuration Server using the CSPSConfigtool.exe for the user mentioned in the previous step 
* The SQL PS module should be installed on SQL Servers running on-premises,and on Azure virtual machines
* The VM Agent should be installed virtual machines running on Azure
* NTAUTHORITY\System should have following permissions on SQL Server running on virtual machines in Azure:
  * ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP  - permissions [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh231018.aspx), and [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ff878601.aspx#Anchor_3)
  * ALTER DATABASE - permissions [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ff877956.aspx#Security)

#### Step 1: Add a SQL Server
1. Click **Add SQL** to add a new SQL Server. 
   
    ![Add SQL](./media/site-recovery-sql/add-sql.png)
2. In **Configure SQL Settings** > **Name** provide a friendly name to refer to the SQL Server.
3. **In SQL Server (FQDN)** specify the FQDN of the source SQL Server that you want to add. In case the SQL Server is installed on a Failover Cluster, then provide FQDN of the cluster and not of any of the cluster nodes.  
4. In **SQL Server Instance** choose the default instance or provide the name of the custom instance.
5. In **Management Server** select a VMM server or Configuration Server registered in the Site Recovery vault. Site Recovery uses this Management server to communicate with the SQL Server.
6. In **Run as Account** provide the name of a RunAs account that was created on the specified VMM server or the Account that was created on the Configuraaaon Server. This account is used to access the SQL Server and should have Read and Failover permissions on availability groups on the SQL Server machine.
   
    ![Add SQL Dialog](./media/site-recovery-sql/add-sql-dialog.png)

After you add the SQL Server it will appear in the **SQL Servers** tab. 

![SQL Server List](./media/site-recovery-sql/sql-server-list.png)

#### Step 2: Add a SQL Availability Group
1. After the SQL Server machine is added the next step is to add the Availability Groups to Site Recovery. To do that, drill down inside the SQL Server added in previous step and click on Add SQL Availability Group. 
   
    ![Add SQL AG](./media/site-recovery-sql/add-sqlag.png)
2. SQL Availability Group can be replicating to one or more virtual machines in Azure. When adding the sql availability group you are required to provide the name and subscription of the Azure virtual machine where you want the availability group to be failed over to by Site Recovery.
   
    ![Add SQL AG Dialog](./media/site-recovery-sql/add-sqlag-dialog.png)
3. In the above example Availability Group DB1-AG would become Primary on virtual machine SQLAGVM2 running inside subscription DevTesting2 on a failover. 

> [!NOTE]
> Only the Availability Groups that are Primary on the SQL Server added in step above are available to be added to Site Recovery. If you have made an Availability Group Primary on the SQL Server or if you have added more Availability Groups on the SQL Server after it was added, refresh it using the Refresh option available on the SQL Server.
> 
> 

#### Step 3: Create a Recovery Plan
The next step is to create a recovery plan using both virtual machines and the availability groups. 
Select the same VMM Server or Configuration Server that you used in Step-1 as source and Microsoft Azure as target.

![Create Recovery Plan](./media/site-recovery-sql/create-rp1.png)

![Create Recovery Plan](./media/site-recovery-sql/create-rp2.png)

In the example the Sharepoint application consists of 3 virtual machines which use a SQL Availability Group as its backend. In this recovery plan we could select both the availability group as well the virtual machine that constitute the application. 

You can further customize the recovery plan by moving virtual machines to different failover groups to sequence the order of failover. Availability group is always failed over first as it would be used as a backend of any application. 

![Customize Recovery Plan](./media/site-recovery-sql/customize-rp.png)

### Step 4:  Fail over
Different failover options are available once an Availability Group has been added to a Recovery Plan.

| Failover | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Planned failover** |Planned Failover implies a no data loss failover. To achieve that SQL Availability Group’s Availability Mode is first set to Synchronous and then a failover is triggered to make the availability group Primary on to the virtual machine provided while adding the availability group to Site Recovery. Once the failover is complete, Availability Mode is set to the same value as it was before the planned failover was triggered. |
| **Unplanned failover** |Unplanned Failover can result into data loss. While triggering unplanned failover the Availability mode of the Availability Group is not changed and the it is made primary on to the virtual machine provided while adding the availability group to Site Recovery. Once unplanned failover is complete and the on-premises server running SQL Server is available again, Reverse Replication has to be triggered on the Availability Group. Note that this action is not available on the recovery plan and can be taken on SQL Availability Group under SQL Servers tab |
| **Test failover** |Test failover for SQL Availability group is not supported. If you trigger Test Failover of a Recovery Plan containing SQL Availability Group, failover would be skipped for Availability Group. |

Consider these failover options.

| Option | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Option 1** |1. Perform a test failover of the application and front-end tiers.<br/><br/>2. Update the application tier to access the replica copy in read-only mode, and perform a read-only test of the application. |
| **Option 2** |1. Create a copy of the replica SQL Server virtual machine instance (using VMM clone for site-to-site or Azure Backup) and bring it up in a test network<br/><br/> 2. Perform the test failover using the recovery plan. |

Step 5: Fail back

If you want to make the Availability Group again Primary on the on-premises SQL Server then you can do so by triggering Planned Failover on the Recovery Plan and choosing the direction from Microsoft Azure to on-premises VMM Server.

> [!NOTE]
> After an unplanned failover reverse replication has to be triggered on the Availability Group to resume the replication. Till this is done the replication remains suspended.

### Protect machines without a VMM Server or a Configuration Server
For the environments that are not managed by a VMM Server or a Configuration Server, Azure Automation Runbooks can be used to configure a scripted failover of SQL Availability Groups. Below are the steps to configure that:

1. Create a local file for the script to fail over an availability group. This sample script specifies a path to the availability group on the Azure replica and fails it over to that replica instance. This script will be run on the SQL Server replica virtual machine by passing is with the custom script extension.
   
     Param(
     [string]$SQLAvailabilityGroupPath
     )
     import-module sqlps
     Switch-SqlAvailabilityGroup -Path $SQLAvailabilityGroupPath -AllowDataLoss -force
2. Upload the script to a blob in an Azure storage account. Use this example:
   
     $context = New-AzureStorageContext -StorageAccountName "Account" -StorageAccountKey "Key"
     Set-AzureStorageBlobContent -Blob "AGFailover.ps1" -Container "script-container" -File "ScriptLocalFilePath" -context $context
3. Create an Azure automation runbook to invoke the scripts on the SQL Server replica virtual machine in Azure. Use this sample script to do this. [Learn more](site-recovery-runbook-automation.md) about using automation runbooks in recovery plans. 
   
     workflow SQLAvailabilityGroupFailover
     {
   
         param (
             [Object]$RecoveryPlanContext
         )
   
         $Cred = Get-AutomationPSCredential -name 'AzureCredential'
   
         #Connect to Azure
         $AzureAccount = Add-AzureAccount -Credential $Cred
         $AzureSubscriptionName = Get-AutomationVariable –Name ‘AzureSubscriptionName’
         Select-AzureSubscription -SubscriptionName $AzureSubscriptionName
   
         InLineScript
         {
          #Update the script with name of your storage account, key and blob name
          $context = New-AzureStorageContext -StorageAccountName "Account" -StorageAccountKey "Key";
          $sasuri = New-AzureStorageBlobSASToken -Container "script-container"- Blob "AGFailover.ps1" -Permission r -FullUri -Context $context;
   
          Write-output "failovertype " + $Using:RecoveryPlanContext.FailoverType;
   
          if ($Using:RecoveryPlanContext.FailoverType -eq "Test")
                {
                #Skipping TFO in this version.
                #We will update the script in a follow-up post with TFO support
                Write-output "tfo: Skipping SQL Failover";
                }
          else
                {
                Write-output "pfo/ufo";
                #Get the SQL Azure Replica VM.
                #Update the script to use the name of your VM and Cloud Service
                $VM = Get-AzureVM -Name "SQLAzureVM" -ServiceName "SQLAzureReplica";     
   
                Write-Output "Installing custom script extension"
                #Install the Custom Script Extension on teh SQL Replica VM
                Set-AzureVMExtension -ExtensionName CustomScriptExtension -VM $VM -Publisher Microsoft.Compute -Version 1.3| Update-AzureVM; 
   
                Write-output "Starting AG Failover";
                #Execute the SQL Failover script
                #Pass the SQL AG path as the argument.
   
                $AGArgs="-SQLAvailabilityGroupPath sqlserver:\sql\sqlazureVM\default\availabilitygroups\testag";
   
                Set-AzureVMCustomScriptExtension -VM $VM -FileUri $sasuri -Run "AGFailover.ps1" -Argument $AGArgs | Update-AzureVM;
   
                Write-output "Completed AG Failover";
   
                }
   
         }
     }
4. When you create a recovery plan for the application add a "pre-Group 1 boot" scripted step that invokes the automation runbook to fail over availability groups.

## Integrate protection with SQL AlwaysOn (on-premises to on-premises)
If the SQL Server is using availability groups for high availability, or a failover cluster instance, we recommend using availability groups on the recovery site as well. Note that this guidance is for applications that don't use distributed transactions.

1. [Configure databases](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh213078.aspx) into availability groups.
2. Create a new virtual network on secondary site.
3. Set up a site-to-site VPN between the new virtual network and the primary site.
4. Create a virtual machine on the recovery site and install SQL Server on it.
5. Extend the existing AlwaysOn availability groups to the new SQL Server virtual machine. Configure this SQL Server instance as an asynchronous replica copy.
6. Create an availability group listener, or update the existing listener to include the asynchronous replica virtual machine.
7. Make sure that the application farm is setup using the listener. If It's setup up using the database server name, please update it to use the listener so you don't need to reconfigure it after the failover.

For applications that use distributed transactions we recommendation you use [Site Recovery with SAN replication](site-recovery-vmm-san.md) or [VMWare/physical server site-to-site replication](site-recovery-vmware-to-vmware.md).

### Recovery plan considerations
1. Add this sample script to the VMM library on the primary and secondary sites.
   
        Param(
        [string]$SQLAvailabilityGroupPath
        )
        import-module sqlps
        Switch-SqlAvailabilityGroup -Path $SQLAvailabilityGroupPath -AllowDataLoss -force
2. When you create a recovery plan for the application add a "pre-Group 1 boot" scripted step that invokes the script to fail over availability groups.

## Protect a standalone SQL Server
In this configuration we recommend you use Site Recovery replication to protect the SQL Server machine. The exact steps will depend whether SQL Server is set up as a virtual machine or physical server, and whether you want to replicate to Azure or a secondary on-premises site. Get instructions for all deployment scenarios in the [Site Recovery Overview](site-recovery-overview.md).

## Protect a SQL Server cluster (Standard or 2008 R2)
For a cluster running SQL Server Standard edition or SQL Server 2008 R2 we recommend you use Site Recovery replication to protect SQL Server.

### On-premises to on-premises
* If the application's uses distributed transactions we recommend you deploy [Site Recovery with SAN replication](site-recovery-vmm-san.md) for a Hyper-V environment and [VMware/physical server to VMware](site-recovery-vmware-to-vmware.md) for VMware environment.
* For non-DTC applications, leverage the above approach to recover the cluster as a stand-alone server by leveraging a local high safety DB mirror.

### On-premises to Azure
Site recovery doesn't support guest cluster support when replicating to Azure. SQL Server also doesn't provide a low-cost disaster recovery solution for Standard edition. We recommend you protect the on-premises SQL Server cluster to a standalone SQL Server and recover it in Azure.

1. Configure an additional standalone SQL Server instance on the on-premises site.
2. Configure this instance to serve as a mirror for the databases that need protection. Configure the mirroring in high safety mode.
3. Configure Site Recovery on the on-premises site based on the environment ([Hyper-V](site-recovery-hyper-v-site-to-azure.md) or [VMware/physical server](site-recovery-vmware-to-azure-classic.md).
4. Use Site Recovery replication to replicate the new SQL Server instance to Azure. It's a high safety mirror copy and so it'll be synchronized with the primary cluster, but it'll be replicated to Azure using Site Recovery replication.

The following graphic illustrates this setup.

![Standard cluster](./media/site-recovery-sql/BCDRStandaloneClusterLocal.png)

### Failback considerations
For SQL standard clusters, failback after an unplanned failover will require a SQL backup and restore from the Mirror instance to the original cluster and re-establishing the mirror.
