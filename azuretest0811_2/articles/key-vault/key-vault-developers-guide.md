# Azure Key Vault Developer's Guide
Using Key Vault, you will be able to securely access sensitive information from within your applications such that:

* Keys and secrets will be protected without having to write the code yourself and you will be easily able to use them from your applications.
* You'll be able to have your customers own and manage their own keys so you can concentrate on providing the core software features. In this way your applications will not own the responsibility or potential liability for your customers’ tenant keys and secrets.
* Your application can use keys for signing and encryption yet keeps the key management external from your application such that the solution is suitable for an application that is geographically distributed.

For more general information on Azure Key Vault, see [What is Key Vault](key-vault-whatis.md).

## Videos
This video shows you how to create your own key vault and how to use it from the 'Hello Key Vault' sample application.

## Creating and Managing Key Vaults
Before working with Azure Key Vault in your code, you can create and manage vaults through REST, Resource Manager Templates, PowerShell or CLI, as described in the following articles:

* [Create and Manage Key Vaults with REST](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/mt620024.aspx)
* [Create and Manage Key Vaults with PowerShell](key-vault-get-started.md)
* [Create and Manage Key Vaults with CLI](key-vault-manage-with-cli.md)
* [Create a key vault and add a secret via an ARM template](../resource-manager-template-keyvault.md)

> [!NOTE]
> Operations against key vaults are authenticated through AAD and authorized through Key Vault’s own Access Policy, defined per vault.

## Coding with Key Vault
The Key Vault management system for programmers consists of several interfaces, with REST as the foundation, [Key Vault REST API Reference](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn903609.aspx).

You can, subject to successful authorization, do the following:

* Manage cryptographic keys using [Create](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn903634.aspx), [Import](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn903626.aspx), [Update](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn903616.aspx), [Delete](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn903611.aspx) and other operations
* Manage secrets using [Get](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn903633.aspx), [Update](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn986818.aspx), [Delete](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn903613.aspx) and other operations
* Use cryptographic keys with [Sign](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn878096.aspx)/[Verify](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn878082.aspx), [WrapKey](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn878066.aspx)/[UnwrapKey](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn878079.aspx) and [Encrypt](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn878060.aspx)/[Decrypt](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn878097.aspx) operations

The following SDKs are available for working with Key Vault:

For complete examples of using Key Vault with your applications, see:

* .NET sample application *HelloKeyVault* and an Azure web service example. [Azure Key Vault code samples](http://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=45343)

## How-tos
The following articles and scenarios provide task specific guidance for working with Azure Key Vault:

* [How to Generate and Transfer HSM-Protected Keys for Azure Key Vault](key-vault-hsm-protected-keys.md) - This will help you plan for, generate and then transfer your own HSM-protected keys to use with Azure Key Vault.
* [How to pass secure values (such as passwords) during deployment](../resource-manager-keyvault-parameter.md) - When you need to pass a secure value (like a password) as a parameter during deployment, you can store that value as a secret in an Azure Key Vault and reference the value in other Resource Manager templates.
* [How to use Key Vault for extensible key management with SQL Server](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn198405.aspx) - The SQL Server Connector for Azure Key Vault enables SQL Server and SQL-in-a-VM to leverage the Azure Key Vault service as an Extensible Key Management (EKM) provider to protect its encryption keys for applications link; Transparent Data Encryption, Backup Encryption, and Column Level Encryption.
* [How to deploy Certificates to VMs from Key Vault](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/kv/2015/07/14/deploy-certificates-to-vms-from-customer-managed-key-vault/) - A cloud application running in a VM on Azure needs a certificate. How do you get this certificate into this VM today?
* [How to integrate Key Vault with Azure Disk Encryption for Windows and Linux IaaS VMs](../azure-security-disk-encryption.md) - This disk encryption solution is integrated with Azure Key Vault to help control and manage the disk encryption keys and secrets in your key vault subscription, while ensuring that all data in the virtual machine disks are encrypted at rest in your Azure storage.
* [How to setup Key Vault with end to end key rotation and auditing](key-vault-key-rotation-log-monitoring.md) - This walks through how to setup key rotation and auditing with Azure Key Vault.

For more task-specific guidance on integrating and using Key Vaults with Azure, see [Ryan Jones ARM template examples for Key Vault](https://github.com/rjmax/ArmExamples/tree/master/keyvaultexamples).

## Integrated with Key Vault
These articles are about other scenarios and services that make us of or integrate with Key Vault. 

* [Azure Disk Encryption](../azure-security-disk-encryption.md) leverages the industry standard [BitLocker](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc732774.aspx) feature of Windows and the [DM-Crypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dm-crypt) feature of Linux to provide volume encryption for the OS and the data disks. The solution is integrated with Azure Key Vault to help you control and manage the disk encryption keys and secrets in your key vault subscription, while ensuring that all data in the virtual machine disks are encrypted at rest in your Azure storage.

## Supporting Libraries
* [Microsoft Azure Key Vault Core Library](http://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.KeyVault.Core/1.0.0) provides `IKey` and `IKeyResolver` interfaces for locating keys from identifiers and performing operations with keys.
* [Microsoft Azure Key Vault Extensions](http://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.KeyVault.Extensions/1.0.0) provides extended capabilities for Azure Key Vault.
