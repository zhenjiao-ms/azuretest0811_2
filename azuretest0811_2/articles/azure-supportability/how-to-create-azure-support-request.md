# How to create an Azure support request
## Summary
Azure customers can create and manage support requests in the Azure portal, [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com).
Based on customer feedback, we’ve updated the support request experience to focus on three main goals:

* **Streamlined**: Reduce clicks and blades to make the process of submitting a support request simple.
* **Integrated**: When you’re troubleshooting an issue with an Azure resource, it should be easy to open a support request for that resource without switching context.
* **Efficient**: Gather the key information your support engineer will need to efficiently resolve your issue.

## Getting started
You can create a support request from the top navigation menu or directly from a resource blade.

**From the top navigation bar**

**From a resource blade**

## Basics
The first step of the support request process gathers basic information about your issue and your support plan.

Let’s take an example: You’re facing technical difficulties with your virtual machine and suspect a network connectivity issue.
Selecting the service ("Virtual Machine running Windows") and the resource (the name of your virtual machine) in the first step of the wizard starts the process of getting help for this issue.

> [!NOTE]
> Azure provides unlimited support for subscription management (things like billing, quota adjustments, and account transfers). For technical support, you need a support plan. [Learn more about support plans](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/plans).

## Problem
The second step of the wizard gathers additional details about the issue. Providing accurate details in this step allows us to route your case to the best support engineer for the issue and to begin diagnosing the issue as soon as possible.

![Problem blade](./media/how-to-create-azure-support-request/Problem.png)

Continuing with the virtual machine connectivity example from above, you would fill out this form to indicate a network connectivity issue, and you would provide further details about the issue, including the approximate time when you experienced the issue.

## Related Help
For some problems, we provide related help links to troubleshoot the issue. If the recommended documents do not help, you can continue through the process to create a support request.

## Contact Information
The last step of the wizard confirms your contact information so we know how to reach you.

Depending on the severity of your issue, you may be asked to indicate if you would like us to contact you during business hours or if you would prefer a 24x7 response, which means we may contact you at any time.

## Manage support requests
After you create the support request, you can view the details from the **Manage Support Requests** page.

**From the top navigation bar**

![Manage Support Request link](./media/how-to-create-azure-support-request/ManageSupportRequest-link.png)

On the **Manage support requests** page, you can view all support requests and their status.

Select the support request to view details, including severity and the expected time it will take for a support engineer to respond.

If you want to change the severity of the request, click the **Business impact** tile. In the preceeding example, the request is currently set to Severity C.

Clicking the tile shows you the list of severities you can assign to an open support request.

> [!NOTE]
> The maximum severity level depends on your support plan. [Learn more about support plans](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/plans).
