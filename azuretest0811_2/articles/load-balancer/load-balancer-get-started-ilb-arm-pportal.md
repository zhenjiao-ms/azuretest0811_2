## Get started creating an Internal load balancer using Azure portal
To create an internal load balancer from the Azure portal, follow the steps below.

1. From a browser, navigate to http://portal.azure.com and, if necessary, sign in with your Azure account.
2. In the upper left hand side of the screen, click **New** > **Networking** > **Load balancer**.
3. In the **Create load balancer** blade, type a **Name** for your load balancer.
4. Under **Scheme**, click **Internal**.
5. Click **Virtual network**, and then select the virtual network where you want to create the load balancer.

> [!NOTE]
> If you do not see the virtual network you want to use, check the **Location** you are using for the load balancer, and change it accordingly.
> 
> 

1. Click **Subnet**, and then select the subnet where you want to create the load balancer.
2. Under **IP address assignment**, click either **Dynamic** or **Static**, depending on whether you want the IP address for the load balancer to be fixed (static) or not.

> [!NOTE]
> If you select to use a static IP address, you will have to provide an address for the load balancer.
> 
> 

1. Under **Resource group** either specify the name of a new resource group for the load balancer, or click **select existing** and select an existing resource group. 
2. Click **Create**. 

## Configure load balancing rules
After the load balancer creation, navigate to the load balancer resource to configure it.
You need to configure first a back-end address pool and a probe before configuring a load balancing rule.

### Step 1
Configure a back-end pool:

1. In the Azure portal, click **Browse** > **Load balancers**, and then click the load balancer you created above.
2. In the **Settings** blade, click **Backend pools**. 
3. In the **Probes** blade, click **Add**.
4. In the **Add backend pool** blade, type a **Name** for the backend pool, and then click **OK**.

### Step 2
Configure a probe:

1. In the Azure portal, click **Browse** > **Load balancers**, and then click the load balancer you created above.
2. In the **Settings** blade, click **Probes**. 
3. In the **Backend address pools** blade, click **Add**.
4. In the **Add probe** blade, type a **Name** for the probe.
5. Under **Protocol**, select **HTTP** (for web sites) or **TCP** (for other TCP based applications).
6. Under **Port**, specify the port to use when accessing the probe.
7. Under **Path** (for HTTP probes only), specify the path to use as a probe.
8. Under **Interval** specify how frequently to probe the application.
9. Under **Unhealthy treshold**, specify how many attempts should fail before the backend VM is marked as unhealthy.
10. click **OK** to create probe.

### Step 3
Configure load balancing rules:

1. In the Azure portal, click **Browse** > **Load balancers**, and then click the load balancer you created above.
2. In the **Settings** blade, click **Load balancing rules**. 
3. In the **Load balancing rules** blade, click **Add**.
4. In the **Add load balancing rule** blade, type a **Name** for the rule.
5. Under **Protocol**, select **HTTP** (for web sites) or **TCP** (for other TCP based applications).
6. Under **Port**, specify the port clients connect to int he load balancer.
7. Under **Backend port**, specify the port to be used in the backend pool (usually, the load balancer port and the backend port are the same).
8. Under **Backend pool**, select the backend pool you created above.
9. Under **Session persistence**, select how you want sessions to persist.
10. Under **Idle timeout (minutes)**, specify the idle timeout.
11. Under **Floating IP (direct server return)**, click **Disabled** or **Enabled**.
12. Click **OK**.
