# Log analytics for Azure Load Balancer (Preview)
You can use different types of logs in Azure to manage and troubleshoot load balancers. Some of these logs can be accessed through the portal, and all logs can be extracted from an Azure blob storage, and viewed in different tools, such as Excel and PowerBI. You can learn more about the different types of logs from the list below.

* **Audit logs:** You can use [Azure Audit Logs](../azure-portal/insights-debugging-with-events.md) (formerly known as Operational Logs) to view all operations being submitted to your Azure subscription(s), and their status. Audit logs are enabled by default, and can be viewed in the Azure portal.
* **Alert event logs:** You can use this log to view what alerts for load balancer are raised. The status for the load balancer is collected every five minutes. This log is only written if a load balancer alert event is raised.  
* **Health probe logs:** You can use this log to check for probe health check status, how many instances are online in the load balancer back-end and percentage of virtual machines receiving network traffic from the load balancer. This log is written on probe status event change.

> [!WARNING]
> Logs are only available for resources deployed in the Resource Manager deployment model. You cannot use logs for resources in the classic deployment model. For a better understanding of the two models, reference the [Understanding Resource Manager deployment and classic deployment](../resource-manager-deployment-model.md) article. <BR>
> Log analytics currently works only for Internet facing load balancers. This limitation is temporary, and may change at any time. Make sure to revisit this page to verify future changes.

## Enable logging
Audit logging is automatically enabled at all times for every Resource Manager resource. You need to enable event and health probe logging to start collecting the data available through those logs. To enable logging, follow the steps below. 

Sign-in to the [Azure portal](http://portal.azure.com). If you don't already have a load balancer, [create a load balancer](load-balancer-get-started-internet-arm-ps.md) before you continue. 

In the portal, click **Browse** >> **Load Balancers**.

![portal - load-balancer](./media/load-balancer-monitor-log/load-balancer-browse.png)

Select an existing load balancer >> **All Settings**.

![portal - load-balancer-settings](./media/load-balancer-monitor-log/load-balancer-settings.png)
<BR>

In the **Settings** blade, click **Diagnostics**, and then in the **Diagnostics** pane, next to **Status**, click **On**
In the **Settings** blade, click **Storage Account**, and either select an existing storage account, or create a new one.

In the drop-down list just under **Storage Account**, select whether you want to log alert events, probe health status or both and then click **Save**.

> [AZURE.INFORMATION] Audit logs do not require a separate storage account. The use of storage for event and health probe logging will incur service charges.

## Audit log
This log (formerly known as the "operational log") is generated by Azure by default.  The logs are preserved for 90 days in Azureâ€™s Event Logs store. Learn more about these logs by reading the [View events and audit logs](../azure-portal/insights-debugging-with-events.md) article.

## Alert event log
This log is only generated if you've enabled it on a per load balancer basis as detailed above. The data is stored in the storage account you specified when you enabled the logging. The information is logged in JSON format, as seen below.

    {
    "time": "2016-01-26T10:37:46.6024215Z",
    "systemId": "32077926-b9c4-42fb-94c1-762e528b5b27",
    "category": "LoadBalancerAlertEvent",
    "resourceId": "/SUBSCRIPTIONS/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXX/RESOURCEGROUPS/RG7/PROVIDERS/MICROSOFT.NETWORK/LOADBALANCERS/WWEBLB",
    "operationName": "LoadBalancerProbeHealthStatus",
    "properties": {
        "eventName": "Resource Limits Hit",
        "eventDescription": "Ports exhausted",
        "eventProperties": {
            "public ip address": "40.117.227.32"
        }
    }


The JSON output shows the *eventname* property which will describe the reason for the load balancer created an alert. In this case, the alert generated was due to TCP port exhaustion caused by source IP NAT limits (SNAT).

## Health probe log
This log is only generated if you've enabled it on a per load balancer basis as detailed above. The data is stored in the storage account you specified when you enabled the logging.  A container named 'insights-logs-loadbalancerprobehealthstatus' is created and the following data is logged:

        {
        "records":

        {
               "time": "2016-01-26T10:37:46.6024215Z",
            "systemId": "32077926-b9c4-42fb-94c1-762e528b5b27",
            "category": "LoadBalancerProbeHealthStatus",
            "resourceId": "/SUBSCRIPTIONS/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXX/RESOURCEGROUPS/RG7/PROVIDERS/MICROSOFT.NETWORK/LOADBALANCERS/WWEBLB",
            "operationName": "LoadBalancerProbeHealthStatus",
            "properties": {
                "publicIpAddress": "40.83.190.158",
                "port": "81",
                "totalDipCount": 2,
                "dipDownCount": 1,
                "healthPercentage": 50.000000
            }
        },
        {
            "time": "2016-01-26T10:37:46.6024215Z",
            "systemId": "32077926-b9c4-42fb-94c1-762e528b5b27",
            "category": "LoadBalancerProbeHealthStatus",
            "resourceId": "/SUBSCRIPTIONS/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXX/RESOURCEGROUPS/RG7/PROVIDERS/MICROSOFT.NETWORK/LOADBALANCERS/WWEBLB",
            "operationName": "LoadBalancerProbeHealthStatus",
            "properties": {
                "publicIpAddress": "40.83.190.158",
                "port": "81",
                "totalDipCount": 2,
                "dipDownCount": 0,
                "healthPercentage": 100.000000
            }
        }

    ]
    }

The JSON output shows in the properties field the basic information for the probe health status. The *dipDownCount* property shows the total number of instances on the back-end which are not receiving network traffic due to failed probe responses. 

## View and analyze the audit log
You can view and analyze audit log data using any of the following methods:

* **Azure tools:** Retrieve information from the audit logs through Azure PowerShell, the Azure Command Line Interface (CLI), the Azure REST API, or the Azure preview portal.  Step-by-step instructions for each method are detailed in the [Audit operations with Resource Manager](../resource-group-audit.md) article.
* **Power BI:** If you don't already have a [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/pricing) account, you can try it for free. Using the [Azure Audit Logs content pack for Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/documentation/powerbi-content-pack-azure-audit-logs) you can analyze your data with pre-configured dashboards that you can use as-is, or customize.

## View and analyze the health probe and event log
You need to connect to your storage account and retrieve the JSON log entries for event and health probe logs. Once you download the JSON files, you can convert them to CSV and view in Excel, PowerBI, or any other data visualization tool.

> [!TIP]
> If you are familiar with Visual Studio and basic concepts of changing values for constants and variables in C#, you can use the [log converter tools](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/networking-dotnet-log-converter) available from Github.
