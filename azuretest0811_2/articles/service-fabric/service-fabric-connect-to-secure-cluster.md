# Connect to a secure cluster
When a client connects to a Service Fabric cluster node, the client can be authenticated and secure communication established using certificate security. This ensures that only authorized users can access the cluster and deployed applications and perform management tasks.  Certificate security must have been previously enabled on the cluster when the cluster was created.  At least two certificates should be used for securing the cluster, one for the cluster and server certificate and another for client access.  We recommend that you also use additional secondary certificates and client access certificates.  For more information on cluster security scenarios, see [Cluster security](service-fabric-cluster-security.md).

To secure the communication between a client and a cluster node using certificate security, you first need to obtain and install the client certificate into the personal (My) store on the local computer or the Personal store for the current user.  You will also need the thumbprint of the server certificate so that the client can authenticate the cluster.

Run the following PowerShell cmdlet to set up the client certificate on the computer from which you will use to access the cluster.

```powershell
Import-PfxCertificate -Exportable -CertStoreLocation Cert:\CurrentUser\My `
        -FilePath C:\docDemo\certs\DocDemoClusterCert.pfx `
        -Password (ConvertTo-SecureString -String test -AsPlainText -Force)
```

If it is a self-signed certificate, you will need to import it to your machine's "trusted people" store before you can use this certificate to connect to a secure cluster.

```powershell
Import-PfxCertificate -Exportable -CertStoreLocation Cert:\CurrentUser\TrustedPeople `
-FilePath C:\docDemo\certs\DocDemoClusterCert.pfx `
-Password (ConvertTo-SecureString -String test -AsPlainText -Force)
```

## Connect to a secure cluster using PowerShell
Run the following PowerShell command to connect to a secure cluster. The certificate details must match a certificate on the cluster nodes.

```powershell
Connect-ServiceFabricCluster -ConnectionEndpoint <Cluster FQDN>:19000 `
          -KeepAliveIntervalInSec 10 `
          -X509Credential -ServerCertThumbprint <Certificate Thumbprint> `
          -FindType FindByThumbprint -FindValue <Certificate Thumbprint> `
          -StoreLocation CurrentUser -StoreName My
```

For example, the PowerShell command above should look similar to the following. *ServerCertThumbprint* is the thumbprint of the server certificate installed on the cluster nodes, *FindValue* is the thumbprint of the admin client certificate.

```powershell
Connect-ServiceFabricCluster -ConnectionEndpoint clustername.westus.cloudapp.azure.com:19000 `
          -KeepAliveIntervalInSec 10 `
          -X509Credential -ServerCertThumbprint A8136758F4AB8962AF2BF3F27921BE1DF67F4326 `
          -FindType FindByThumbprint -FindValue 71DE04467C9ED0544D021098BCD44C71E183414E `
          -StoreLocation CurrentUser -StoreName My
```

## Connect to a secure cluster using the FabricClient APIs
The following [FabricClient](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.fabric.fabricclient.aspx). The nodes in the cluster must have valid certificates whose common name or DNS name in SAN appears in the [RemoteCommonNames property](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/system.fabric.x509credentials.remotecommonnames.aspx) set on [FabricClient](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.fabric.fabricclient.aspx). This enables mutual authentication between the client and the cluster node.

```csharp
string clientCertThumb = "71DE04467C9ED0544D021098BCD44C71E183414E";
string serverCertThumb = "A8136758F4AB8962AF2BF3F27921BE1DF67F4326";
string CommonName = "www.clustername.westus.azure.com";
string connection = "clustername.westus.cloudapp.azure.com:19000";

X509Credentials xc = GetCredentials(clientCertThumb, serverCertThumb, CommonName);
FabricClient fc = new FabricClient(xc, connection);
Task<bool> t = fc.PropertyManager.NameExistsAsync(new Uri("fabric:/any"));
try
{
    bool result = t.Result;
    Console.WriteLine("Cluster is connected");
}
catch (AggregateException ae)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Connect failed: {0}", ae.InnerException.Message);
}
catch (Exception e)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Connect failed: {0}", e.Message);
}

...

static X509Credentials GetCredentials(string clientCertThumb, string serverCertThumb, string name)
{
    X509Credentials xc = new X509Credentials();

    // Client certificate
    xc.StoreLocation = StoreLocation.CurrentUser;
    xc.StoreName = "MY";
    xc.FindType = X509FindType.FindByThumbprint;
    xc.FindValue = thumb;

    // Server certificate
    xc.RemoteCertThumbprints.Add(thumb);
    xc.RemoteCommonNames.Add(name);

    xc.ProtectionLevel = ProtectionLevel.EncryptAndSign;
    return xc;
}
```
