# How to Invoke Data Loss on Services

## Introduction
You can invoke data loss on a partition of your Service Fabric Service by calling StartPartitionDataLossAsync().  This api uses the Fault Injection and Analysis Service to perform the work to cause data loss conditions.

## Using the Fault Injection and Analysis Service
The Fault Injection and Analysis Service currently supports the following APIs in the chart below.  The right side of the chart shows the corresponding PowerShell cmdlet.  Please refer to the msdn documentation on each API for more information on each one.

## Conceptual Overview of Running a Command
The Fault Injection and Analysis Service uses an asynchronous model where you start the command with one API, referred to as the “Start” API in this document, then checks the progress of this command using a “GetProgress” API until it has reached a terminal state, or until you cancel it.
To start a command, call the “Start” API for the corresponding API.  This API returns when the Fault Injection and Analysis Service has accepted the request.  However, it does not indicate how far a command has run, or even if it has started yet.  In order to check progress of a command, call the “GetProgress” API that corresponds to the “Start” API previously called.  The “GetProgress” API will return an object indicating the current status of the command inside its State property.  A command runs indefinitely until:

1. It completes successfully.  If you call “GetProgress” on it in this case, the progress object’s State will be Completed.
2. It encounters a fatal error.  If you call “GetProgress” on it in this case, the progress object’s State will be Faulted
3. You cancel it through the [CancelTestCommandAsync](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/mt668910.aspx) API, or [Stop-ServiceFabricTestCommand](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt697566.aspx) PowerShell cmdlet.  If you call “GetProgress” on it in this case, the progress object’s State will be either Cancelled or ForceCancelled, depending on an argument to that API.  See the documentation for [CancelTestCommandAsync](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/mt668910.aspx) for more details.

## Details of Running a Command
In order to start a command, call the Start API with the expected arguments.  All Start APIs have a Guid argument named operationId.  You should keep track of the operationId argument, since it is used to track progress of this command.  This must be passed into the “GetProgress” API in order to track progress of the command.  The operationId must be unique.

After successfully calling the Start API, the GetProgress API should be called in a loop until the returned progress object’s State property is Completed.  All [FabricTransientException’s](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/system.fabric.fabrictransientexception.aspx) and OperationCanceledException’s should be retried.
When the command has reached a terminal state (Completed, Faulted, or Cancelled), the returned progress object’s Result property will have additional information.  If the state is Completed, Result.SelectedPartition.PartitionId will contain the partition id that was selected.  Result.Exception will be null.  If the state is Faulted, Result.Exception will have the reason the Fault Injection and Analysis Service faulted the command.  Result.SelectedPartition.PartitionId will have the partition id that was selected.  In some situations, the command may not have proceeded far enough to choose a partition.  In that case, the PartitionId will be 0.  If the state is Cancelled, Result.Exception will be null.  Like the Faulted case, Result.SelectedPartition.PartitionId will have the partition id that was chosen, but if the command has not proceeded far enough to do so, it will be 0.  Please also refer to the sample below.

The sample code below shows how to start then check progress on a command to restart a specific partition.

```csharp
    static async Task PerformDataLossSample()
    {
        // Create a unique operation id for the command below
        Guid operationId = Guid.NewGuid();

        // Note: Use the appropriate overload for your configuration
        FabricClient fabricClient = new FabricClient();

        // The name of the target service
        Uri targetServiceName = new Uri("fabric:/MyService");

        // The id of the target partition inside the target service
        Guid targetPartitionId = new Guid("00000000-0000-0000-0000-000002233445");

        PartitionSelector partitionSelector = PartitionSelector.PartitionIdOf(targetServiceName, targetPartitionId);

        // Start the command.  Retry OperationCanceledException and all FabricTransientException's.  Note when StartPartitionDataLossAsync completes
        // successfully it only means the Fault Injection and Analysis Service has saved the intent to perform this work.  It does not say anything about the progress
        // of the command.
        while (true)
        {
            try
            {
                await fabricClient.TestManager.StartPartitionDataLossAsync(operationId, partitionSelector, DataLossMode.FullDataLoss).ConfigureAwait(false);
                break;
            }
            catch (OperationCanceledException)
            {
            }
            catch (FabricTransientException)
            {
            }

            await Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1.0d)).ConfigureAwait(false);
        }

        PartitionDataLossProgress progress = null;

        // Poll the progress using GetPartitionDataLossProgressAsync until it is either Completed or Faulted.  In this example, we're assuming
        // the command won't be cancelled.        

        while (true)
        {
            try
            {
                progress = await fabricClient.TestManager.GetPartitionDataLossProgressAsync(operationId).ConfigureAwait(false);
            }
            catch (OperationCanceledException)
            {
                continue;
            }
            catch (FabricTransientException)
            {
                continue;
            }

            if (progress.State == TestCommandProgressState.Completed)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Command '{0}' completed successfully", operationId);

                // In a terminal state .Result.SelectedPartition.PartitionId will have the chosen partition
                Console.WriteLine("  Printing selected partition='{0}'", progress.Result.SelectedPartition.PartitionId);
                break;
            }
            else if (progress.State == TestCommandProgressState.Faulted)
            {
                // If State is Faulted, the progress object's Result property's Exception property will have the reason why.
                Console.WriteLine("Command '{0}' failed with '{1}'", operationId, progress.Result.Exception);
                break;
            }
            else
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Command '{0}' is currently Running", operationId);
            }

            await Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5.0d)).ConfigureAwait(false);
        }
    }
```

The sample below shows how to use the PartitionSelector to choose a random partition of a specified service:

```csharp
    static async Task PerformDataLossUseSelectorSample()
    {
        // Create a unique operation id for the command below
        Guid operationId = Guid.NewGuid();

        // Note: Use the appropriate overload for your configuration
        FabricClient fabricClient = new FabricClient();

        // The name of the target service
        Uri targetServiceName = new Uri("fabric:/SampleService ");

        // Use a PartitionSelector that will have the Fault Injection and Analysis Service choose a random partition of “targetServiceName”
        PartitionSelector partitionSelector = PartitionSelector.RandomOf(targetServiceName);

        // Start the command.  Retry OperationCanceledException and all FabricTransientException's.  Note when StartPartitionDataLossAsync completes
        // successfully it only means the Fault Injection and Analysis Service has saved the intent to perform this work.  It does not say anything about the progress
        // of the command.
        while (true)
        {
            try
            {
                await fabricClient.TestManager.StartPartitionDataLossAsync(operationId, partitionSelector, DataLossMode.FullDataLoss).ConfigureAwait(false);
                break;
            }
            catch (OperationCanceledException)
            {
            }
            catch (FabricTransientException)
            {
            }
            catch (Exception e)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Unexpected exception '{0}'", e);
                throw;
            }

            await Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1.0d)).ConfigureAwait(false);
        }

        PartitionDataLossProgress progress = null;

        // Poll the progress using GetPartitionDataLossProgressAsync until it is either Completed or Faulted.  In this example, we're assuming
        // the command won't be cancelled.

        while (true)
        {
            try
            {
                progress = await fabricClient.TestManager.GetPartitionDataLossProgressAsync(operationId).ConfigureAwait(false);
            }
            catch (OperationCanceledException)
            {
                continue;
            }
            catch (FabricTransientException)
            {
                continue;
            }

            if (progress.State == TestCommandProgressState.Completed)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Command '{0}' completed successfully", operationId);

                Console.WriteLine("Printing progress.Result:");
                Console.WriteLine("  Printing selected partition='{0}'", progress.Result.SelectedPartition.PartitionId);

                break;
            }
            else if (progress.State == TestCommandProgressState.Faulted)
            {
                // If State is Faulted, the progress object's Result property's Exception property will have the reason why.
                Console.WriteLine("Command '{0}' failed with '{1}', SelectedPartition {2}", operationId, progress.Result.Exception, progress.Result.SelectedPartition);
                break;
            }
            else
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Command '{0}' is currently Running", operationId);
            }

            await Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1.0d)).ConfigureAwait(false);
        }
    }
```

## History and Truncation
After a command has reached a terminal state, its metadata will remain in the Fault Injection and Analysis Service for a certain time, before it will be removed to save space.  If “GetProgress” is called using the operationId of a command after it has been removed, it will return a FabricException with an ErrorCode of KeyNotFound.
