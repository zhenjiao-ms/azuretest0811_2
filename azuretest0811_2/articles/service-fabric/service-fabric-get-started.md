# Prepare your development environment
 To build and run [Azure Service Fabric applications](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/campaigns/service-fabric/ "Service Fabric campaign page") on your development machine, install the runtime, SDK, and tools. You also need to enable execution of the Windows PowerShell scripts included in the SDK.

## Prerequisites
### Supported operating system versions
The following operating system versions are supported for development:

* Windows 7
* Windows 8/Windows 8.1
* Windows Server 2012 R2
* Windows 10

> [!NOTE]
> Windows 7 only includes Windows PowerShell 2.0 by default. Service Fabric PowerShell cmdlets requires PowerShell 3.0 or higher. You can [download Windows PowerShell 5.0](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=50395) from the Microsoft Download Center.
> 
> 

## Install the runtime, SDK, and tools
The Web Platform Installer offers three configurations for Service Fabric development:

* [Install the Service Fabric runtime, SDK, and tools for Visual Studio 2015 Update 2](http://www.microsoft.com/web/handlers/webpi.ashx?command=getinstallerredirect&appid=MicrosoftAzure-ServiceFabric-VS2015-2_1 "VS 2015 WebPI link")
* [Install the Service Fabric runtime, SDK, and tools for Visual Studio "15" Preview](http://www.microsoft.com/web/handlers/webpi.ashx?command=getinstallerredirect&appid=MicrosoftAzure-ServiceFabric-Dev15-2_1 "Dev15 WebPI link")
* [Install the Service Fabric runtime and SDK only (no Visual Studio tools)](http://www.microsoft.com/web/handlers/webpi.ashx?command=getinstallerredirect&appid=ServiceFabricSDK_2_1 "Core SDK WebPI link")

## Enable PowerShell script execution
Service Fabric uses Windows PowerShell scripts for creating a local development cluster and for deploying applications from Visual Studio. By default, Windows blocks these scripts from running. To enable them, you must modify your PowerShell execution policy. Open PowerShell as an administrator and enter the following command:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Force -Scope CurrentUser
```

## Next steps
Now that you've finished setting up your development environment, start building and running apps.
