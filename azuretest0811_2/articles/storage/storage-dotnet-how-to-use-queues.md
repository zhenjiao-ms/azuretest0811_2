## Overview
Azure Queue storage provides cloud messaging between application components. In designing applications for scale, application components are often decoupled, so that they can scale independently. Queue storage delivers asynchronous messaging for communication between application components, whether they are running in the cloud, on the desktop, on an on-premises server, or on a mobile device. Queue storage also supports managing asynchronous tasks and building process work flows.

### About this tutorial
This tutorial shows how to write .NET code for some common scenarios using Azure Queue storage. Scenarios covered include creating and deleting queues and adding, reading, and deleting queue messages.

### Add namespace declarations
Add the following `using` statements to the top of the `program.cs` file:

    using Microsoft.Azure; // Namespace for CloudConfigurationManager 
    using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage; // Namespace for CloudStorageAccount
    using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage.Queue; // Namespace for Queue storage types

### Parse the connection string
[!INCLUDE [storage-cloud-configuration-manager-include](../../includes/storage-cloud-configuration-manager-include.md)]

### Create the Queue service client
The **CloudQueueClient** class enables you to retrieve queues stored in Queue storage. Here's one way to create the service client:

    CloudQueueClient queueClient = storageAccount.CreateCloudQueueClient();

Now you are ready to write code that reads data from and writes data to Queue storage.

## Create a queue
This example shows how to create a queue if it does not already exist:

    // Retrieve storage account from connection string.
    CloudStorageAccount storageAccount = CloudStorageAccount.Parse(
        CloudConfigurationManager.GetSetting("StorageConnectionString"));

    // Create the queue client.
    CloudQueueClient queueClient = storageAccount.CreateCloudQueueClient();

    // Retrieve a reference to a container.
    CloudQueue queue = queueClient.GetQueueReference("myqueue");

    // Create the queue if it doesn't already exist
    queue.CreateIfNotExists();

## Insert a message into a queue
To insert a message into an existing queue, first create a new
**CloudQueueMessage**. Next, call the **AddMessage** method. A
**CloudQueueMessage** can be created from either a string (in UTF-8
format) or a **byte** array. Here is code which creates a queue (if it
doesn't exist) and inserts the message 'Hello, World':

    // Retrieve storage account from connection string.
    CloudStorageAccount storageAccount = CloudStorageAccount.Parse(
        CloudConfigurationManager.GetSetting("StorageConnectionString"));

    // Create the queue client.
    CloudQueueClient queueClient = storageAccount.CreateCloudQueueClient();

    // Retrieve a reference to a queue.
    CloudQueue queue = queueClient.GetQueueReference("myqueue");

    // Create the queue if it doesn't already exist.
    queue.CreateIfNotExists();

    // Create a message and add it to the queue.
    CloudQueueMessage message = new CloudQueueMessage("Hello, World");
    queue.AddMessage(message);

## Peek at the next message
You can peek at the message in the front of a queue without removing it
from the queue by calling the **PeekMessage** method.

    // Retrieve storage account from connection string
    CloudStorageAccount storageAccount = CloudStorageAccount.Parse(
        CloudConfigurationManager.GetSetting("StorageConnectionString"));

    // Create the queue client
    CloudQueueClient queueClient = storageAccount.CreateCloudQueueClient();

    // Retrieve a reference to a queue
    CloudQueue queue = queueClient.GetQueueReference("myqueue");

    // Peek at the next message
    CloudQueueMessage peekedMessage = queue.PeekMessage();

    // Display message.
    Console.WriteLine(peekedMessage.AsString);

## Change the contents of a queued message
You can change the contents of a message in-place in the queue. If the
message represents a work task, you could use this feature to update the
status of the work task. The following code updates the queue message
with new contents, and sets the visibility timeout to extend another 60
seconds. This saves the state of work associated with the message, and
gives the client another minute to continue working on the message. You
could use this technique to track multi-step workflows on queue
messages, without having to start over from the beginning if a
processing step fails due to hardware or software failure. Typically,
you would keep a retry count as well, and if the message is retried more
than *n* times, you would delete it. This protects against a message
that triggers an application error each time it is processed.

    // Retrieve storage account from connection string.
    CloudStorageAccount storageAccount = CloudStorageAccount.Parse(
        CloudConfigurationManager.GetSetting("StorageConnectionString"));

    // Create the queue client.
    CloudQueueClient queueClient = storageAccount.CreateCloudQueueClient();

    // Retrieve a reference to a queue.
    CloudQueue queue = queueClient.GetQueueReference("myqueue");

    // Get the message from the queue and update the message contents.
    CloudQueueMessage message = queue.GetMessage();
    message.SetMessageContent("Updated contents.");
    queue.UpdateMessage(message,
        TimeSpan.FromSeconds(60.0),  // Make it visible for another 60 seconds.
        MessageUpdateFields.Content | MessageUpdateFields.Visibility);

## De-queue the next message
Your code de-queues a message from a queue in two steps. When you call
**GetMessage**, you get the next message in a queue. A message returned
from **GetMessage** becomes invisible to any other code reading messages
from this queue. By default, this message stays invisible for 30
seconds. To finish removing the message from the queue, you must also
call **DeleteMessage**. This two-step process of removing a message
assures that if your code fails to process a message due to hardware or
software failure, another instance of your code can get the same message
and try again. Your code calls **DeleteMessage** right after the message
has been processed.

    // Retrieve storage account from connection string
    CloudStorageAccount storageAccount = CloudStorageAccount.Parse(
        CloudConfigurationManager.GetSetting("StorageConnectionString"));

    // Create the queue client
    CloudQueueClient queueClient = storageAccount.CreateCloudQueueClient();

    // Retrieve a reference to a queue
    CloudQueue queue = queueClient.GetQueueReference("myqueue");

    // Get the next message
    CloudQueueMessage retrievedMessage = queue.GetMessage();

    //Process the message in less than 30 seconds, and then delete the message
    queue.DeleteMessage(retrievedMessage);

## Use Async-Await pattern with common Queue storage APIs
This example shows how to use the Async-Await pattern with common Queue storage APIs. The sample calls the asynchronous version of each of the given methods, as indicated by the *Async* suffix of each method. When an async method is used, the async-await pattern suspends local execution until the call completes. This behavior allows the current thread to do other work, which helps avoid performance bottlenecks and improves the overall responsiveness of your application. For more details on using the Async-Await pattern in .NET see [Async and Await (C# and Visual Basic)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh191443.aspx)

    // Create the queue if it doesn't already exist
    if(await queue.CreateIfNotExistsAsync())
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Queue '{0}' Created", queue.Name);
    }
    else
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Queue '{0}' Exists", queue.Name);
    }

    // Create a message to put in the queue
    CloudQueueMessage cloudQueueMessage = new CloudQueueMessage("My message");

    // Async enqueue the message
    await queue.AddMessageAsync(cloudQueueMessage);
    Console.WriteLine("Message added");

    // Async dequeue the message
    CloudQueueMessage retrievedMessage = await queue.GetMessageAsync();
    Console.WriteLine("Retrieved message with content '{0}'", retrievedMessage.AsString);

    // Async delete the message
    await queue.DeleteMessageAsync(retrievedMessage);
    Console.WriteLine("Deleted message");

## Leverage additional options for de-queuing messages
There are two ways you can customize message retrieval from a queue.
First, you can get a batch of messages (up to 32). Second, you can set a
longer or shorter invisibility timeout, allowing your code more or less
time to fully process each message. The following code example uses the
**GetMessages** method to get 20 messages in one call. Then it processes
each message using a **foreach** loop. It also sets the invisibility
timeout to five minutes for each message. Note that the 5 minutes starts
for all messages at the same time, so after 5 minutes have passed since
the call to **GetMessages**, any messages which have not been deleted
will become visible again.

    // Retrieve storage account from connection string.
    CloudStorageAccount storageAccount = CloudStorageAccount.Parse(
        CloudConfigurationManager.GetSetting("StorageConnectionString"));

    // Create the queue client.
    CloudQueueClient queueClient = storageAccount.CreateCloudQueueClient();

    // Retrieve a reference to a queue.
    CloudQueue queue = queueClient.GetQueueReference("myqueue");

    foreach (CloudQueueMessage message in queue.GetMessages(20, TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5)))
    {
        // Process all messages in less than 5 minutes, deleting each message after processing.
        queue.DeleteMessage(message);
    }

## Get the queue length
You can get an estimate of the number of messages in a queue. The
**FetchAttributes** method asks the Queue service to
retrieve the queue attributes, including the message count. The **ApproximateMessageCount**
property returns the last value retrieved by the
**FetchAttributes** method, without calling the Queue service.

    // Retrieve storage account from connection string.
    CloudStorageAccount storageAccount = CloudStorageAccount.Parse(
        CloudConfigurationManager.GetSetting("StorageConnectionString"));

    // Create the queue client.
    CloudQueueClient queueClient = storageAccount.CreateCloudQueueClient();

    // Retrieve a reference to a queue.
    CloudQueue queue = queueClient.GetQueueReference("myqueue");

    // Fetch the queue attributes.
    queue.FetchAttributes();

    // Retrieve the cached approximate message count.
    int? cachedMessageCount = queue.ApproximateMessageCount;

    // Display number of messages.
    Console.WriteLine("Number of messages in queue: " + cachedMessageCount);

## Delete a queue
To delete a queue and all the messages contained in it, call the
**Delete** method on the queue object.

    // Retrieve storage account from connection string.
    CloudStorageAccount storageAccount = CloudStorageAccount.Parse(
        CloudConfigurationManager.GetSetting("StorageConnectionString"));

    // Create the queue client.
    CloudQueueClient queueClient = storageAccount.CreateCloudQueueClient();

    // Retrieve a reference to a queue.
    CloudQueue queue = queueClient.GetQueueReference("myqueue");

    // Delete the queue.
    queue.Delete();
