# How to use Blob storage from Java
[!INCLUDE [storage-selector-blob-include](../../includes/storage-selector-blob-include.md)]

## Overview
Azure Blob storage is a service that stores unstructured data in the cloud as objects/blobs. Blob storage can store any type of text or binary data, such as a document, media file, or application installer. Blob storage is also referred to as object storage.

This article will show you how to perform common scenarios using the Microsoft Azure Blob storage. The samples are written in Java and use the [Azure Storage SDK for Java](https://github.com/azure/azure-storage-java). The scenarios covered include **uploading**, **listing**, **downloading**, and **deleting** blobs. For more information on blobs, see the [Next Steps](#Next-Steps) section.

> [!NOTE]
> An SDK is available for developers who are using Azure Storage on Android devices. For more information, see the [Azure Storage SDK for Android](https://github.com/azure/azure-storage-android).

## Create a Java application
In this article, you will use storage features which can be run within a Java application locally, or in code running within a web role or worker role in Azure.

To do so, you will need to install the Java Development Kit (JDK) and create an Azure Storage account in your Azure subscription. Once you have done so, you will need to verify that your development system meets the minimum requirements and dependencies which are listed in the [Azure Storage SDK for Java](https://github.com/azure/azure-storage-java) repository on GitHub. If your system meets those requirements, you can follow the instructions for downloading and installing the Azure Storage Libraries for Java on your system from that repository. Once you have completed those tasks, you will be able to create a Java application which uses the examples in this article.

## Configure your application to access Blob storage
Add the following import statements to the top of the Java file where you want to use the Azure Storage APIs to access blobs.

    // Include the following imports to use blob APIs.
    import com.microsoft.azure.storage.*;
    import com.microsoft.azure.storage.blob.*;

## Set up an Azure Storage connection string
An Azure Storage client uses a storage connection string to store
endpoints and credentials for accessing data management services. When running in a client application, you must provide the storage connection string in the following format, using the name of your storage account and the Primary access key for the storage account listed in the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) for the *AccountName* and *AccountKey* values. The following example shows how you can declare a static field to hold the connection string.

    // Define the connection-string with your values
    public static final String storageConnectionString =
        "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=http;" +
        "AccountName=your_storage_account;" +
        "AccountKey=your_storage_account_key";

In an application running within a role in Microsoft Azure, this string can be stored in the service configuration file, *ServiceConfiguration.cscfg*, and can be accessed with a call to the **RoleEnvironment.getConfigurationSettings** method. The followng example gets the connection string from a **Setting** element named *StorageConnectionString* in the service configuration file.

    // Retrieve storage account from connection-string.
    String storageConnectionString =
        RoleEnvironment.getConfigurationSettings().get("StorageConnectionString");

The following samples assume that you have used one of these two methods to get the storage connection string.

## Create a container
A **CloudBlobClient** object lets you get reference objects for containers and blobs. The following code creates a **CloudBlobClient** object.

> [!NOTE]
> There are additional ways to create **CloudStorageAccount** objects; for more information, see **CloudStorageAccount** in the [Azure Storage Client SDK Reference](http://dl.windowsazure.com/storage/javadoc/).
> 
> 

[!INCLUDE [storage-container-naming-rules-include](../../includes/storage-container-naming-rules-include.md)]

Use the **CloudBlobClient** object to get a reference to the container you want to use. You can create the container if it doesn't exist with the **createIfNotExists** method, which will otherwise return the existing container. By default, the new container is private, so you must specify your storage access key (as you did earlier) to download blobs from this container.

    try
    {
        // Retrieve storage account from connection-string.
        CloudStorageAccount storageAccount = CloudStorageAccount.parse(storageConnectionString);

        // Create the blob client.
       CloudBlobClient blobClient = storageAccount.createCloudBlobClient();

       // Get a reference to a container.
       // The container name must be lower case
       CloudBlobContainer container = blobClient.getContainerReference("mycontainer");

       // Create the container if it does not exist.
        container.createIfNotExists();
    }
    catch (Exception e)
    {
        // Output the stack trace.
        e.printStackTrace();
    }

### Optional: Configure a container for public access
A container's permissions are configured for private access by default, but you can easily configure a container's permissions to allow public, read-only access for all users on the Internet:

    // Create a permissions object.
    BlobContainerPermissions containerPermissions = new BlobContainerPermissions();

    // Include public access in the permissions object.
    containerPermissions.setPublicAccess(BlobContainerPublicAccessType.CONTAINER);

    // Set the permissions on the container.
    container.uploadPermissions(containerPermissions);

## Upload a blob into a container
To upload a file to a blob, get a container reference and use it to get a blob reference. Once you have a blob reference, you can upload any stream by calling upload on the blob reference. This operation will create the blob if it doesn't exist, or overwrite it if it does. The following code sample shows this, and assumes that the container has already been created.

    try
    {
        // Retrieve storage account from connection-string.
        CloudStorageAccount storageAccount = CloudStorageAccount.parse(storageConnectionString);

        // Create the blob client.
        CloudBlobClient blobClient = storageAccount.createCloudBlobClient();

       // Retrieve reference to a previously created container.
        CloudBlobContainer container = blobClient.getContainerReference("mycontainer");

        // Define the path to a local file.
        final String filePath = "C:\\myimages\\myimage.jpg";

        // Create or overwrite the "myimage.jpg" blob with contents from a local file.
        CloudBlockBlob blob = container.getBlockBlobReference("myimage.jpg");
        File source = new File(filePath);
        blob.upload(new FileInputStream(source), source.length());
    }
    catch (Exception e)
    {
        // Output the stack trace.
        e.printStackTrace();
    }

## List the blobs in a container
To list the blobs in a container, first get a container reference like you did to upload a blob. You can use the container's **listBlobs** method with a **for** loop. The following code outputs the Uri of each blob in a container to the console.

    try
    {
        // Retrieve storage account from connection-string.
        CloudStorageAccount storageAccount = CloudStorageAccount.parse(storageConnectionString);

        // Create the blob client.
        CloudBlobClient blobClient = storageAccount.createCloudBlobClient();

        // Retrieve reference to a previously created container.
        CloudBlobContainer container = blobClient.getContainerReference("mycontainer");

        // Loop over blobs within the container and output the URI to each of them.
        for (ListBlobItem blobItem : container.listBlobs()) {
           System.out.println(blobItem.getUri());
       }
    }
    catch (Exception e)
    {
        // Output the stack trace.
        e.printStackTrace();
    }

Note that you can name blobs with path information in their names. This creates a virtual directory structure that you can organize and traverse as you would a traditional file system. Note that the directory structure is virtual only - the only resources available in Blob storage are containers and blobs. However, the client library offers a **CloudBlobDirectory** object to refer to a virtual directory and simplify the process of working with blobs that are organized in this way.

For example, you could have a container named "photos", in which you might upload blobs named "rootphoto1", "2010/photo1", "2010/photo2", and "2011/photo1". This would create the virtual directories "2010" and "2011" within the "photos" container. When you call **listBlobs** on the "photos" container, the collection returned will contain **CloudBlobDirectory** and **CloudBlob** objects representing the directories and blobs contained at the top level. In this case, directories "2010" and "2011", as well as photo "rootphoto1" would be returned. You can use the **instanceof** operator to distinguish these objects.

Optionally, you can pass in parameters to the **listBlobs** method with
the **useFlatBlobListing** parameter set to true. This will result in
every blob being returned, regardless of directory. For more
information, see **CloudBlobContainer.listBlobs** in the [Azure Storage Client SDK Reference](http://dl.windowsazure.com/storage/javadoc/).

## Download a blob
To download blobs, follow the same steps as you did for uploading a blob in order to get a blob reference. In the uploading example, you called upload on the blob object. In the following example, call download to transfer the blob contents to a stream object such as a **FileOutputStream** that you can use to persist the blob to a local file.

    try
    {
        // Retrieve storage account from connection-string.
       CloudStorageAccount storageAccount = CloudStorageAccount.parse(storageConnectionString);

       // Create the blob client.
       CloudBlobClient blobClient = storageAccount.createCloudBlobClient();

       // Retrieve reference to a previously created container.
       CloudBlobContainer container = blobClient.getContainerReference("mycontainer");

       // Loop through each blob item in the container.
       for (ListBlobItem blobItem : container.listBlobs()) {
           // If the item is a blob, not a virtual directory.
           if (blobItem instanceof CloudBlob) {
               // Download the item and save it to a file with the same name.
                CloudBlob blob = (CloudBlob) blobItem;
                blob.download(new FileOutputStream("C:\\mydownloads\\" + blob.getName()));
            }
        }
    }
    catch (Exception e)
    {
        // Output the stack trace.
        e.printStackTrace();
    }

## Delete a blob
To delete a blob, get a blob reference, and call **deleteIfExists**.

    try
    {
       // Retrieve storage account from connection-string.
       CloudStorageAccount storageAccount = CloudStorageAccount.parse(storageConnectionString);

       // Create the blob client.
       CloudBlobClient blobClient = storageAccount.createCloudBlobClient();

       // Retrieve reference to a previously created container.
       CloudBlobContainer container = blobClient.getContainerReference("mycontainer");

       // Retrieve reference to a blob named "myimage.jpg".
       CloudBlockBlob blob = container.getBlockBlobReference("myimage.jpg");

       // Delete the blob.
       blob.deleteIfExists();
    }
    catch (Exception e)
    {
        // Output the stack trace.
        e.printStackTrace();
    }

## Delete a blob container
Finally, to delete a blob container, get a blob container reference, and
call **deleteIfExists**.

    try
    {
       // Retrieve storage account from connection-string.
       CloudStorageAccount storageAccount = CloudStorageAccount.parse(storageConnectionString);

       // Create the blob client.
       CloudBlobClient blobClient = storageAccount.createCloudBlobClient();

       // Retrieve reference to a previously created container.
       CloudBlobContainer container = blobClient.getContainerReference("mycontainer");

       // Delete the blob container.
       container.deleteIfExists();
    }
    catch (Exception e)
    {
        // Output the stack trace.
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
