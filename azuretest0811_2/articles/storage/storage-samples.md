# Azure Storage samples
## Overview
Use the links below to view and download working Azure Storage samples.

## Azure Code Sample Library
The [Azure Code Sample Library](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/samples/?service=storage) includes samples for Azure Storage that you can download and run locally. The Code Sample Library provides sample code in .zip format. Alternatively, you can browse and clone the GitHub repository for each sample.

## Getting started samples
* [Get started with Azure Storage in five minutes](storage-getting-started-guide.md)
* [Visual Studio Quick Starts for Azure Storage](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-net/tree/master/Samples/GettingStarted/VisualStudioQuickStarts)

## .NET samples
To explore the .NET samples, download the [.NET Storage Client Library](https://www.nuget.org/packages/WindowsAzure.Storage/) from NuGet. The .NET storage client library is also available in the [Azure SDK for .NET](https://azure.microsoft.com/downloads/).

* [Getting Started with Azure Blob Service in .NET](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/samples/storage-blob-dotnet-getting-started/)
* [Getting Started with Azure Queue Service in .NET](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/samples/storage-queue-dotnet-getting-started/)
* [Getting Started with Azure Table Service in .NET](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/samples/storage-table-dotnet-getting-started/)
* [Getting Started with Azure File Service in .NET](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/samples/storage-file-dotnet-getting-started/)
* [Azure Blob Storage Photo Gallery Web Application](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/samples/storage-blobs-dotnet-webapp/)

* [Get started with tables](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-java/tree/master/microsoft-azure-storage-samples/src/com/microsoft/azure/storage/table/gettingtstarted)
* [Get started with queues](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-java/tree/master/microsoft-azure-storage-samples/src/com/microsoft/azure/storage/queue/gettingstarted)

## Node.js samples
To explore the Node.js samples, download the [Node.js Storage Client Library](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-node).

* [Blob uploader](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-node/tree/master/examples/blobuploader)
* [Upload and download blob](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-node/blob/master/examples/samples/blobuploaddownloadsample.js)
* [Continuation token](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-node/blob/master/examples/samples/continuationsample.js)
