# Analyze data usage in Log Analytics
Log Analytics in the Operations Management Suite (OMS) collects data and sends it to the OMS service periodically.  You can use the **Usage** page to view how much data is being sent to the OMS service. The **Usage** page also shows you how much data is being sent daily by solutions and how often your servers are sending data.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have a free account created using the [OMS website](http://www.microsoft.com/oms), you're limited to sending 500 MB of data to the OMS service daily. If you reach the daily limit, data analysis will stop and resume at the start of the next day. You'll also need to resend any data that wasn't accepted or processed by OMS.
> 
> 

You can view your usage by using the **Usage** tile on the **Overview** dashboard in OMS.

If you have exceeded your daily usage limit, or if you are near your limit, you can optionally remove a solution to reduce the amount of data that you send to the OMS service. For more information about removing solutions, see [Add Log Analytics solutions from the Solutions Gallery](log-analytics-add-solutions.md).

The **Usage** page displays the following information:

* Average usage per day
* Data usage for each solution over the last 30 days
* How much data the servers in your environment are sending to the OMS service over the last 30 days
* Your data plan pricing tier and estimated cost
* Information about your service level agreement (SLA), including how long it takes OMS to process your data
