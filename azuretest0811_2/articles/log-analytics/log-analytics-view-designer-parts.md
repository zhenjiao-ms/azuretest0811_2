# Log Analytics View Designer visualization part reference
The View Designer in Log Analytics allows you to create custom views in the OMS console that contain different visualizations of data from the OMS repository. This article provides a reference of the settings for each of the visualization parts available to use in your custom views.

Other articles available for View Designer are:

* [View Designer](log-analytics-view-designer.md) - Overview of the View Designer and procedures for creating and editing custom views.
* [Tile reference](log-analytics-view-designer-tiles.md) - Reference of the settings for each of the tiles available to use in your custom views. 

The following table describes the different types of tiles available in the View Designer.  The sections below describe each tile type in detail and their properties.

| View Type | Description |
|:--- |:--- |
| [List of queries](#list-of-queries-part) |Displays a list of log search queries.  The user can click on each query to display its results.  The view will include a single query by default, and you can click **+ Query** to add additional queries. |
| [Number & list](#number-amp-list-part) |Header has a single number showing count of records from a log search query.  List displays the top ten results from a query with horizontal bars indicating the relative value of a numeric column. |
| [Two numbers & list](#two-numbers-amp-list-part) |Header has two numbers showing count of records from separate log search queries.  List displays the top ten results from a query with horizontal bars indicating the relative value of a numeric column. |
| [Donut & list](#donut-amp-list-part) |Header displays a single number summarized from a value column in a log query.  The donut graphically displays results of the top three records. |
| [Two timelines & list](#two-timelines-amp-list-part) |Header displays the results of two log queries over time as column charts with a callout displaying a single number summarized from a value column in a log query.  List displays the top ten results from a query with horizontal bars indicating the relative value of a numeric column. |
| [Information](#information-part) |Header displays static text and an optional link.  List displays one or more items with static text and title. |
| [Line chart, callout, & list](#line-chart-callout-amp-list-part) |Header displays a line chart with multiple series from a log query over time and a callout with a summarized value.  List displays the top ten results from a query with horizontal bars indicating the relative value of a numeric column. |
| [Line chart & list](#line-chart-amp-list-part) |Header displays a line chart with multiple series from a log query over time.  List displays the top ten results from a query with horizontal bars indicating the relative value of a numeric column. |
