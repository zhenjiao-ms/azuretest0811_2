# Change Tracking solution in Log Analytics
You can use the Configuration Change Tracking solution in Log Analytics to help you easily identify software and Windows Services changes that occur in your environment — identifying these configuration changes can help you pinpoint operational issues.

You install the solution to update the type of agent that you have installed. Changes to installed software and Windows services on the monitored servers are read and then the data is sent to the Log Analytics service in the cloud for processing. Logic is applied to the received data and the cloud service records the data. When changes are found, servers with changes are shown in the Change Tracking dashboard. By using the information on the Change Tracking dashboard, you can easily see the changes that were made in your server infrastructure.

## Installing and configuring the solution
Use the following information to install and configure the solution.

* Operations Manager is required for the Change Tracking solution.
* You must have a Windows or Operations Manager agent on each computer where you want to monitor changes.
* Add the Change Tracking solution to your OMS workspace using the process described in [Add Log Analytics solutions from the Solutions Gallery](log-analytics-add-solutions.md).  There is no further configuration required.

## Change Tracking data collection details
Change Tracking collects software inventory and Windows Service metadata using the agents that you have enabled.

The following table shows data collection methods and other details about how data is collected for Change Tracking.

| platform | Direct Agent | SCOM agent | Azure Storage | SCOM required? | SCOM agent data sent via management group | collection frequency |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Windows |![Yes](./media/log-analytics-change-tracking/oms-bullet-green.png) |![Yes](./media/log-analytics-change-tracking/oms-bullet-green.png) |![No](./media/log-analytics-change-tracking/oms-bullet-red.png) |![No](./media/log-analytics-change-tracking/oms-bullet-red.png) |![Yes](./media/log-analytics-change-tracking/oms-bullet-green.png) |hourly |

## Use Change Tracking
After the solution is installed, you can view the summary of changes for your monitored servers by using the **Change Tracking** tile on the **Overview** page in OMS.

You can view changes to your infrastructure and then drill-into details for the following categories:

* Changes by configuration type for software and Windows services
* Software changes to applications and updates for individual servers
* Total number of software changes for each application
* Windows service changes for individual servers

### To view changes for any change type
1. On the **Overview** page, click the **Change Tracking** tile.
2. On the **Change Tracking** dashboard, review the summary information in one of the change type blades and then click one to view detailed information about it in the **log search** page.
3. On any of the log search pages, you can view results by time, detailed results, and your log search history. You can also filter by facets to narrow the results.

## Next steps
* Use [Log searches in Log Analytics](log-analytics-log-searches.md) to view detailed change tracking data.
