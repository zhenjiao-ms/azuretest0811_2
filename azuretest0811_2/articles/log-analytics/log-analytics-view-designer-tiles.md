# Log Analytics View Designer Tile Reference
The View Designer in Log Analytics allows you to create custom Views in the OMS console that contain different visualizations of data in the OMS repository. This article provides a reference of the settings for each of the tiles available to use in your custom views.

Other articles available for View Designer are:

* [View Designer](log-analytics-view-designer.md) - Overview of the View Designer and procedures for creating and editing custom views.
* [Visualization part reference](log-analytics-view-designer-parts.md) - Reference of the settings for each of the tiles available to use in your custom views. 

The following table lists the different types of tiles available in the View Designer.  The sections below describe each tile type in detail and their properties.

| Tile | Description |
|:--- |:--- |
| [Number](#number-tile) |Single number showing count of records from a query. |
| [Two numbers](#two-numbers-tile) |Two single numbers showing counts of records from two different queries. |
| [Donut](#donut-tile) |Donut chart based on a query with a summary value in the center. |
| [Line chart & callout](#line-chart-amp-callout-tile) |Line chart based on a query and a callout with a summary value. |
| [Line chart](#line-chart-tile) |Line chart based on a query. |
| [Two timelines](#two-timelines-tile) |Column chart with two series each based on a separate query. |

## Number tile
The **Number** tile displays a single number showing the count of records from a log query and a label.

![Number tile](media/log-analytics-view-designer/tile-number.png)

| Setting | Description |
|:--- |:--- |
| Name |Text to display at the top of the tile. |
| Description |Text to display under the tile name. |
| **Tile** | |
| Legend |Text to display under the value. |
| Query |Query to run.  The count of the number of records returned by the query will be displayed. |
| **Advanced** |**> Data-flow verification** |
| Enabled |Select if data-flow verification should be enabled for the tile.  This provides an alternate message if data is not available for the tile.  This is typically used to provide a message during the temporary period when the view is installed and data comes available. |
| Query |Query to run to check if data is available for the view.  If the query returns no results, then a message is displayed instead of the value from the main query. |
| Message |Message to display if the data-flow verification query returns no data.  If you provide no message, *Performing Assessment* is displayed. |
| **Time Interval** | |
| Duration |Duration from the current date to use for the time interval of the query.  For example, if **7 days** is specified, then the query is limited to records created from 7 days ago to the current date. |
| End data offset |Optional offset from the current data to use for the time interval of the main query.  For example, if **-1 day** is used for the **End date offset** and **7 days** used for the **Duration**, then the query is limited to records created from 8 days ago to yesterday. |

## Two Numbers tile
The **Two Number** tile displays two numbers showing the count of records from two different log queries and a label for each.

| End data offset |Optional offset from the current data to use for the time interval of the main query.  For example, if **-1 day** is used for the **End date offset** and **7 days** used for the **Duration**, then the query is limited to records created from 8 days ago to yesterday. |

## Donut tile
The **Donut** tile displays a single number summarized from a value column in a log query.  The donut graphically displays results of the top three records.
