# Collecting Azure storage data in Log Analytics overview
Many Azure resources are able to write logs and metrics to an Azure storage account. Log Analytics can consume this data and make it easier to monitor your Azure resources.

To write to Azure storage a resource may use Azure diagnostics, or have its own way to write data. This data may be written in various formats to one of the following locations:

* Azure table
* Azure blob
* EventHub

Log Analytics supports Azure services that write data using Azure diagnostics to blob storage in JSON format. In addition, Log Analytics supports other services that output logs and metrics in different formats and locations.  

> [!NOTE]
> You'll be charged normal Azure data rates for storage and transactions when you send diagnostics to a storage account and for when Log Analytics reads the data from your storage account.

## Supported Azure Resources
Log Analytics can collect data for the following Azure resources:

| Resource Type | Logs (Diagnostic Categories) | Log Analytics Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Application Insights |Availability <br> Custom Events <br> Exceptions <br> Requests <br> |Application Insights (Preview) |
| API Management | |*none* (Preview) |
| Automation <br> Microsoft.Automation/AutomationAccounts |JobLogs <br> JobStreams |AzureAutomation (Preview) |
| Key Vault <br> Microsoft.KeyVault/Vaults |AuditEvent |KeyVault (Preview) |
| Application Gateway <br> Microsoft.Network/ApplicationGateways |ApplicationGatewayAccessLog <br> ApplicationGatewayPerformanceLog |AzureNetworking (Preview) |
| Network Security Group <br> Microsoft.Network/NetworkSecurityGroups |NetworkSecurityGroupEvent <br> NetworkSecurityGroupRuleCounter |AzureNetworking (Preview) |
| Service Fabric |ETWEvent <br> Operational Event <br> Reliable Actor Event <br> Reliable Service Event |ServiceFabric (Preview) |
| Virtual Machines |Linux Syslog <br> Windows Event <br> IIS Log <br> Windows ETWEvent |*none* |
| Web Roles <br> Worker Roles |Linux Syslog <br> Windows Event <br> IIS Log <br> Windows ETWEvent |*none* |

> [!NOTE]
> For monitoring Azure virtual machines (both Linux and Windows) we recommend installing the Microsoft Monitoring Agent VM extension. This will provide you with deeper insights on your virtual machines than if you use the diagnostics written to storage.

  * Azure Key Vault
  * Azure Automation
  * Application Gateway
  * Network security groups
* See [Use blob storage for IIS and table storage for events](log-analytics-azure-storage-iis-table.md) to learn more about how Log Analytics can read the logs for Azure services that write diagnostics to table storage or IIS logs written to blob storage, including:

Application Insights is in private preview and it uses continuous export to blob storage.
