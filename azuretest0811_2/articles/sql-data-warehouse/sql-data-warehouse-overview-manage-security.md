This article walks through the basics of securing your Azure SQL Data Warehouse database. In particular, this article will get you started with resources for limiting access, protecting data, and monitoring activities on a database.

## Connection security
Connection Security refers to how you restrict and secure connections to your database using firewall rules and connection encryption.

Firewall rules are used by both the server and the database to reject connection attempts from IP addresses that have not been explicitly whitelisted. To allow connections from your application or client machine's public IP address, you must first create a server-level firewall rule using the Azure Classic Portal, REST API, or PowerShell. As a best practice, you should restrict the IP address ranges allowed through your server firewall as much as possible.  To access Azure SQL Data Warehouse from your local computer, ensure the firewall on your network and local computer allows outgoing communication on TCP port 1433.  For more information, see [Azure SQL Database firewall](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ee621782.aspx), [sp_set_firewall_rule](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn270017.aspx), and [sp_set_database_firewall_rule](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn270010.aspx).

Connections to your SQL Data Warehouse can be encrypted by setting the encryption mode in your connection string.  The syntax for turning on encryption for the connection varies by protocol.  To help you set up your connection string, navigate to your database on the Azure Portal.  Under *Essentials* click on *Show database connection strings*.

## Authentication
Authentication refers to how you prove your identity when connecting to the database. SQL Data Warehouse currently supports SQL Server Authentication with a username and password as well as a preview of Azure Active Directory. 

When you created the logical server for your database, you specified a "server admin" login with a username and password. Using these credentials, you can authenticate to any database on that server as the database owner, or "dbo" through SQL Server Authentication.

However, as a best practice, your organizationâ€™s users should use a different account to authenticate. This way you can limit the permissions granted to the application and reduce the risks of malicious activity in case your application code is vulnerable to a SQL injection attack. 

To create a SQL Server Authenticated user, connect to the **master** database on your server with your server admin login and create a new server login.

```sql
-- Connect to master database and create a login
CREATE LOGIN ApplicationLogin WITH PASSWORD = 'strong_password';

```

Then, connect to your **SQL Data Warehouse database** with your server admin login and create a database user based on the server login you just created.

```sql
-- Connect to SQL DW database and create a database user
CREATE USER ApplicationUser FOR LOGIN ApplicationLogin;

```

For more information on authenticating to a SQL Database, see [Managing databases and logins in Azure SQL Database](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ee336235.aspx).  For more details on using the Azure AD preview for SQL Data Warehouse, see [Connecting to SQL Data Warehouse By Using Azure Active Directory Authentication](./sql-data-warehouse-get-started-connect-aad-authentication.md).

## Authorization
Authorization refers to what you can do within an Azure SQL Data Warehouse database, and this is controlled by your user account's role memberships and permissions. As a best practice, you should grant users the least privileges necessary. Azure SQL Data Warehouse makes this easy to manage with roles in T-SQL:

```sql
EXEC sp_addrolemember 'db_datareader', 'ApplicationUser'; -- allows ApplicationUser to read data
EXEC sp_addrolemember 'db_datawriter', 'ApplicationUser'; -- allows ApplicationUser to write data
```

The server admin account you are connecting with is a member of db_owner, which has authority to do anything within the database. Save this account for deploying schema upgrades and other management operations. Use the "ApplicationUser" account with more limited permissions to connect from your application to the database with the least privileges needed by your application.

There are ways to further limit what a user can do with Azure SQL Database:

* Granular [Permissions](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms191291.aspx) let you control which operations you can do on individual columns, tables, views, procedures, and other objects in the database. Use granular permissions to have the most control and grant the minimum permissions necessary. The granular permission system is somewhat complicated and will require some study to use effectively.
* [Database roles](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms189121.aspx) other than db_datareader and db_datawriter can be used to create more powerful application user accounts or less powerful management accounts. The built-in fixed database roles provide an easy way to grant permissions, but can result in granting more permissions than are necessary.
* [Stored procedures](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms190782.aspx) can be used to limit the actions that can be taken on the database.

Managing databases and logical servers from the Azure Classic Portal or using the Azure Resource Manager API is controlled by your portal user account's role assignments. For more information on this topic, see [Role-based access control in Azure Portal](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/role-based-access-control-configure).

## Encryption
Azure SQL Data Warehouse can help protect your data by encrypting your data when it is "at rest," or stored in database files and backups, using [Transparent Data Encryption](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=526242). You must be an administrator or a member of the dbmanager role in the master database to enable TDE. To encrypt your database, connect to the master database on your server and execute:

```sql

ALTER DATABASE [AdventureWorks] SET ENCRYPTION ON;

```

You can also enable Transparent Data Encryption from database settings in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/). For more information, see [Get started with Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)](sql-data-warehouse-encryption-tde.md).

## Auditing
Auditing and tracking database events can help you maintain regulatory compliance and identify suspicious activity. SQL Data Warehouse Auditing allows you to record events in your database to an audit log in your Azure Storage account. SQL Data Warehouse Auditing also integrates with Microsoft Power BI to facilitate drill-down reports and analyses. For more information, see [Get started with SQL Database Auditing](./sql-data-warehouse-overview-auditing.md).
