# Create Table As Select (CTAS) in SQL Data Warehouse
Create table as select or `CTAS` is one of the most important T-SQL features available. It is a fully parallelized operation that creates a new table based on the output of a SELECT statement. `CTAS` is the simplest and fastest way to create a copy of a table. You can consider it to be a supercharged version of `SELECT..INTO` if you would like. This document provides both examples and best practices for `CTAS`.

## Using CTAS to copy a table
Perhaps one of the most common uses of `CTAS` is creating a copy of a table so that you can change the DDL. If for example you originally created your table as `ROUND_ROBIN` and now want change it to a table distributed on a column, `CTAS` is how you would change the distribution column. `CTAS` can also be used to change partitioning, indexing, or column types.

Let's say you created this table using the default distribution type of `ROUND_ROBIN` distributed since no distribution column was specified in the `CREATE TABLE`.

```sql
CREATE TABLE FactInternetSales
(
    ProductKey int NOT NULL,
    OrderDateKey int NOT NULL,
    DueDateKey int NOT NULL,
    ShipDateKey int NOT NULL,
    CustomerKey int NOT NULL,
    PromotionKey int NOT NULL,
    CurrencyKey int NOT NULL,
    SalesTerritoryKey int NOT NULL,
    SalesOrderNumber nvarchar(20) NOT NULL,
    SalesOrderLineNumber tinyint NOT NULL,
    RevisionNumber tinyint NOT NULL,
    OrderQuantity smallint NOT NULL,
    UnitPrice money NOT NULL,
    ExtendedAmount money NOT NULL,
    UnitPriceDiscountPct float NOT NULL,
    DiscountAmount float NOT NULL,
    ProductStandardCost money NOT NULL,
    TotalProductCost money NOT NULL,
    SalesAmount money NOT NULL,
    TaxAmt money NOT NULL,
    Freight money NOT NULL,
    CarrierTrackingNumber nvarchar(25),
    CustomerPONumber nvarchar(25)
);
```

Now you want to create a new copy of this table with a Clustered Columnstore Index so that you can take advantage of the performance of Clustered Columnstore tables. You also want to distribute this table on ProductKey since you are anticipating joins on this column and want to avoid data movement during joins on ProductKey. Lastly you also want to add partitioning on OrderDateKey so that you can quickly delete old data by dropping old partitions. Here is the CTAS statement which would copy your old table into a new table.

```sql
CREATE TABLE FactInternetSales_new
WITH
(
    CLUSTERED COLUMNSTORE INDEX,
    DISTRIBUTION = HASH(ProductKey),
    PARTITION
    (
        OrderDateKey RANGE RIGHT FOR VALUES
        (
        20000101,20010101,20020101,20030101,20040101,20050101,20060101,20070101,20080101,20090101,
        20100101,20110101,20120101,20130101,20140101,20150101,20160101,20170101,20180101,20190101,
        20200101,20210101,20220101,20230101,20240101,20250101,20260101,20270101,20280101,20290101
        )
    )
)
AS SELECT * FROM FactInternetSales;
```

Finally you can rename your tables to swap in your new table and then drop your old table.

```sql
RENAME OBJECT FactInternetSales TO FactInternetSales_old;
RENAME OBJECT FactInternetSales_new TO FactInternetSales;

DROP TABLE FactInternetSales_old;
```

> [!NOTE]
> Azure SQL Data Warehouse does not yet support auto create or auto update statistics.  In order to get the best performance from your queries, it's important that statistics be created on all columns of all tables after the first load or any substantial changes occur in the data.  For a detailed explanation of statistics, see the [Statistics](sql-data-warehouse-tables-statistics.md) topic in the Develop group of topics.

## Using CTAS to work around unsupported features
`CTAS` can also be used to work around a number of the unsupported features listed below. This can often prove to be a win/win situation as not only will your code be compliant but it will often execute faster on SQL Data Warehouse. This is as a result of its fully parallelized design. Scenarios that can be worked around with CTAS include:

* SELECT..INTO
* ANSI JOINS on UPDATEs
* ANSI JOINs on DELETEs
* MERGE statement

> [!NOTE]
> Try to think "CTAS first". If you think you can solve a problem using `CTAS` then that is generally the best way to approach it - even if you are writing more data as a result.
> 
> 

## SELECT..INTO
You may find `SELECT..INTO` appears in a number of places in your solution.

Below is an example of a `SELECT..INTO` statement:

```sql
SELECT *
INTO    #tmp_fct
FROM    [dbo].[FactInternetSales]
```

To convert the above to `CTAS` is quite straight-forward:

```sql
CREATE TABLE #tmp_fct
WITH
(
    DISTRIBUTION = ROUND_ROBIN
)
AS
SELECT  *
FROM    [dbo].[FactInternetSales]
;
```

> [!NOTE]
> CTAS currently requires a distribution column be specified.  If you are not intentionally trying to change the distribution column, your `CTAS` will perform the fastest if you select a distribution column that is the same as the underlying table as this strategy avoids data movement.  If you are creating a small table where performance is not a factor, then you can specify `ROUND_ROBIN` to avoid having to decide on a distribution column.

## ANSI join replacement for update statements
You may find you have a complex update that joins more than two tables together using ANSI joining syntax to perform the UPDATE or DELETE.

Imagine you had to update this table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE [dbo].[AnnualCategorySales]
(    [EnglishProductCategoryName]    NVARCHAR(50)    NOT NULL
,    [CalendarYear]                    SMALLINT        NOT NULL
,    [TotalSalesAmount]                MONEY            NOT NULL
)
WITH
(
    DISTRIBUTION = ROUND_ROBIN
)
;
```

The original query might have looked something like this:

```sql
UPDATE    acs
SET        [TotalSalesAmount] = [fis].[TotalSalesAmount]
FROM    [dbo].[AnnualCategorySales]     AS acs
JOIN    (
        SELECT    [EnglishProductCategoryName]
        ,        [CalendarYear]
        ,        SUM([SalesAmount])                AS [TotalSalesAmount]
        FROM    [dbo].[FactInternetSales]        AS s
        JOIN    [dbo].[DimDate]                    AS d    ON s.[OrderDateKey]                = d.[DateKey]
        JOIN    [dbo].[DimProduct]                AS p    ON s.[ProductKey]                = p.[ProductKey]
        JOIN    [dbo].[DimProductSubCategory]    AS u    ON p.[ProductSubcategoryKey]    = u.[ProductSubcategoryKey]
        JOIN    [dbo].[DimProductCategory]        AS c    ON u.[ProductCategoryKey]        = c.[ProductCategoryKey]
        WHERE     [CalendarYear] = 2004
        GROUP BY
                [EnglishProductCategoryName]
        ,        [CalendarYear]
        ) AS fis
ON    [acs].[EnglishProductCategoryName]    = [fis].[EnglishProductCategoryName]
AND    [acs].[CalendarYear]                = [fis].[CalendarYear]
;
```

Since SQL Data Warehouse does not support ANSI joins in the `FROM` clause of an `UPDATE` statement, you cannot copy this code over without changing it slightly.

You can use a combination of a `CTAS` and an implicit join to replace this code:

```sql
-- Create an interim table
CREATE TABLE CTAS_acs
WITH (DISTRIBUTION = ROUND_ROBIN)
AS
SELECT    ISNULL(CAST([EnglishProductCategoryName] AS NVARCHAR(50)),0)    AS [EnglishProductCategoryName]
,        ISNULL(CAST([CalendarYear] AS SMALLINT),0)                         AS [CalendarYear]
,        ISNULL(CAST(SUM([SalesAmount]) AS MONEY),0)                        AS [TotalSalesAmount]
FROM    [dbo].[FactInternetSales]        AS s
JOIN    [dbo].[DimDate]                    AS d    ON s.[OrderDateKey]                = d.[DateKey]
JOIN    [dbo].[DimProduct]                AS p    ON s.[ProductKey]                = p.[ProductKey]
JOIN    [dbo].[DimProductSubCategory]    AS u    ON p.[ProductSubcategoryKey]    = u.[ProductSubcategoryKey]
JOIN    [dbo].[DimProductCategory]        AS c    ON u.[ProductCategoryKey]        = c.[ProductCategoryKey]
WHERE     [CalendarYear] = 2004
GROUP BY
        [EnglishProductCategoryName]
,        [CalendarYear]
;

-- Use an implicit join to perform the update
UPDATE  AnnualCategorySales
SET     AnnualCategorySales.TotalSalesAmount = CTAS_ACS.TotalSalesAmount
FROM    CTAS_acs
WHERE   CTAS_acs.[EnglishProductCategoryName] = AnnualCategorySales.[EnglishProductCategoryName]
AND     CTAS_acs.[CalendarYear]               = AnnualCategorySales.[CalendarYear]
;

--Drop the interim table
DROP TABLE CTAS_acs
;
```

## ANSI join replacement for delete statements
Sometimes the best approach for deleting data is to use `CTAS`. Rather than deleting the data simply select the data you want to keep. This especially true for `DELETE` statements that use ansi joining syntax since SQL Data Warehouse does not support ANSI joins in the `FROM` clause of a `DELETE` statement.

An example of a converted DELETE statement is available below:

```sql
CREATE TABLE dbo.DimProduct_upsert
WITH
(   Distribution=HASH(ProductKey)
,   CLUSTERED INDEX (ProductKey)
)
AS -- Select Data you wish to keep
SELECT     p.ProductKey
,          p.EnglishProductName
,          p.Color
FROM       dbo.DimProduct p
RIGHT JOIN dbo.stg_DimProduct s
ON         p.ProductKey = s.ProductKey
;

RENAME OBJECT dbo.DimProduct        TO DimProduct_old;
RENAME OBJECT dbo.DimProduct_upsert TO DimProduct;
```

## Replace merge statements
Merge statements can be replaced, at least in part, by using `CTAS`. You can consolidate the `INSERT` and the `UPDATE` into a single statement. Any deleted records would need to be closed off in a second statement.

An example of an `UPSERT` is available below:

```sql
CREATE TABLE dbo.[DimProduct_upsert]
WITH
(   DISTRIBUTION = HASH([ProductKey])
,   CLUSTERED INDEX ([ProductKey])
)
AS
-- New rows and new versions of rows
SELECT      s.[ProductKey]
,           s.[EnglishProductName]
,           s.[Color]
FROM      dbo.[stg_DimProduct] AS s
UNION ALL  
-- Keep rows that are not being touched
SELECT      p.[ProductKey]
,           p.[EnglishProductName]
,           p.[Color]
FROM      dbo.[DimProduct] AS p
WHERE NOT EXISTS
(   SELECT  *
    FROM    [dbo].[stg_DimProduct] s
    WHERE   s.[ProductKey] = p.[ProductKey]
)
;

RENAME OBJECT dbo.[DimProduct]          TO [DimProduct_old];
RENAME OBJECT dbo.[DimpProduct_upsert]  TO [DimProduct];

```

## CTAS recommendation: Explicitly state data type and nullability of output
When migrating code you might find you run across this type of coding pattern:

```sql
DECLARE @d decimal(7,2) = 85.455
,       @f float(24)    = 85.455

CREATE TABLE result
(result DECIMAL(7,2) NOT NULL
)
WITH (DISTRIBUTION = ROUND_ROBIN)

INSERT INTO result
SELECT @d*@f
;
```

Instinctively you might think you should migrate this code to a CTAS and you would be correct. However, there is a hidden issue here.

The following code does NOT yield the same result:

```sql
DECLARE @d decimal(7,2) = 85.455
,       @f float(24)    = 85.455
;

CREATE TABLE ctas_r
WITH (DISTRIBUTION = ROUND_ROBIN)
AS
SELECT @d*@f as result
;
```

Notice that the column "result" carries forward the data type and nullability values of the expression. This can lead to subtle variances in values if you aren't careful.

Try the following as an example:

```sql
SELECT result,result*@d
from result
;

SELECT result,result*@d
from ctas_r
;
```

The value stored for result is different. As the persisted value in the result column is used in other expressions the error becomes even more significant.

![](media/sql-data-warehouse-develop-ctas/ctas-results.png)

This is particularly important for data migrations. Even though the second query is arguably more accurate there is a problem. The data would be different compared to the source system and that leads to questions of integrity in the migration. This is one of those rare cases where the "wrong" answer is actually the right one!

The reason we see this disparity between the two results is down to implicit type casting. In the first example the table defines the column definition. When the row is inserted an implicit type conversion occurs. In the second example there is no implicit type conversion as the expression defines data type of the column. Notice also that the column in the second example has been defined as a NULLable column whereas in the first example it has not. When the table was created in the first example column nullability was explicitly defined. In the second example it was just left to the expression and by default this would result in a NULL definition.  

To resolve these issues you must explicitly set the type conversion and nullability in the `SELECT` portion of the `CTAS` statement. You cannot set these properties in the create table part.

The example below demonstrates how to fix the code:

```sql
DECLARE @d decimal(7,2) = 85.455
,       @f float(24)    = 85.455

CREATE TABLE ctas_r
WITH (DISTRIBUTION = ROUND_ROBIN)
AS
SELECT ISNULL(CAST(@d*@f AS DECIMAL(7,2)),0) as result
```

Note the following:

* CAST or CONVERT could have been used
* ISNULL is used to force NULLability not COALESCE
* ISNULL is the outermost function
* The second part of the ISNULL is a constant i.e. 0

> [!NOTE]
> For the nullability to be correctly set it is vital to use `ISNULL` and not `COALESCE`. `COALESCE` is not a deterministic function and so the result of the expression will always be NULLable. `ISNULL` is different. It is deterministic. Therefore when the second part of the `ISNULL` function is a constant or a literal then the resulting value will be NOT NULL.

This tip is not just useful for ensuring the integrity of your calculations. It is also important for table partition switching. Imagine you have this table defined as your fact:

```sql
CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Sales]
(
    [date]      INT     NOT NULL
,   [product]   INT     NOT NULL
,   [store]     INT     NOT NULL
,   [quantity]  INT     NOT NULL
,   [price]     MONEY   NOT NULL
,   [amount]    MONEY   NOT NULL
)
WITH
(   DISTRIBUTION = HASH([product])
,   PARTITION   (   [date] RANGE RIGHT FOR VALUES
                    (20000101,20010101,20020101
                    ,20030101,20040101,20050101
                    )
                )
)
;
```

However, the value field is a calculated expression it is not part of the source data.

To create your partitioned dataset you might want to do this:

```sql
CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Sales_in]
WITH    
(   DISTRIBUTION = HASH([product])
,   PARTITION   (   [date] RANGE RIGHT FOR VALUES
                    (20000101,20010101
                    )
                )
)
AS
SELECT
    [date]    
,   [product]
,   [store]
,   [quantity]
,   [price]   
,   [quantity]*[price]  AS [amount]
FROM [stg].[source]
OPTION (LABEL = 'CTAS : Partition IN table : Create')
;
```

The query would run perfectly fine. The problem comes when you try to perform the partition switch. The table definitions do not match. To make the table definitions match the CTAS needs to be modified.

```sql
CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Sales_in]
WITH    
(   DISTRIBUTION = HASH([product])
,   PARTITION   (   [date] RANGE RIGHT FOR VALUES
                    (20000101,20010101
                    )
                )
)
AS
SELECT
    [date]    
,   [product]
,   [store]
,   [quantity]
,   [price]   
,   ISNULL(CAST([quantity]*[price] AS MONEY),0) AS [amount]
FROM [stg].[source]
OPTION (LABEL = 'CTAS : Partition IN table : Create');
```

You can see therefore that type consistency and maintaining nullability properties on a CTAS is a good engineering best practice. It helps to maintain integrity in your calculations and also ensures that partition switching is possible.

Please refer to MSDN for more information on using [CTAS](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt204041.aspx). It is one of the most important statements in Azure SQL Data Warehouse. Make sure you thoroughly understand it.
