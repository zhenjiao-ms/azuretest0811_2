# Create a New Logical Server
In SQL Database and SQL Data Warehouse, each database is assigned to a server, and each server is assigned to a geographical location. The server is called a logical SQL server.

> [!NOTE]
> <a name="note"></a>A logical SQL server:
> 
> * Provides a consistent way to configure multiple databases within the same geographical location.
> * Is not physical hardware like it is for an on-premises server. It  is part of the service software. This is why we call it a *logical server*.
> * Can host multiple databases without impacting their performance.
> * Uses a lower case *s* in its name. SQL **s**erver is an Azure logical server, whereas SQL **S**erver is Microsoft's on-premises database product.

1. Click **Server** > **Create a new server**. There is no charge for the server. If you already have a V12 logical SQL server that you want to use, choose your existing server and go to the next step.

2. Fill in the **New server** information.
   
   * **Server Name**: Enter a name for your logical server. This is unique for each geographical location.
   * **Server Admin Name**: Enter a user name for the server administrator account.
   * **Password**: Enter the server admin password.
   * **Location**: Choose a geographical location for your server. To reduce data transfer time, it's best to locate your server geographically close to other data resources this database will access.
   * **Create V12 Server**: YES is the only option for SQL Data Warehouse.
   * **Allow azure services to access server**: This is always checked for SQL Data Warehouse
     
     > [!NOTE]
     > Be sure to store the server name, server admin name, and password somewhere.  You will need this information to log on to the server.
     > 
3. Click **OK** to save the logical SQL server configuration settings and return to the SQL Data Warehouse blade.
