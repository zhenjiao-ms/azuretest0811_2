Partitioning is supported on all SQL Data Warehouse table types; including clustered columnstore, clustered index, and heap.  Partitioning is also supported on all distribution types, including both hash or round robin distributed.  Partitioning enables you to divide your data into smaller groups of data and in most cases, partitioning is done on a date column.

## Benefits of partitioning
Partitioning can benefit data maintenance and query performance.  Whether it benefits both or just one is dependent on how data is loaded and whether the same column can be used for both purposes, since partitioning can only be done on one column.

### Benefits to loads
The primary benefit of partitioning in SQL Data Warehouse is improve the efficiency and performance of loading data by use of partition deletion, switching and merging.  In most cases data is partitioned on a date column that is closely tied to the sequence which the data is loaded to the database.  One of the greatest benefits of using partitions to maintain data it the avoidance of transaction logging.  While simply inserting, updating or deleting data can be the most straightforward approach, with a little thought and effort, using partitioning during your load process can substantially improve performance.

Partition switching can be used to quickly remove or replace a section of a table.  For example, a sales fact table might contain just data for the past 36 months.  At the end of every month, the oldest month of sales data is deleted from the table.  This data could be deleted by using a delete statement to delete the data for the oldest month.  However, deleting a large amount of data row-by-row with a delete statement can take a very long time, as well as create the risk of large transactions which could take a long time to rollback if something goes wrong.  A more optimal approach is to simply drop the oldest partition of data.  Where deleting the individual rows could take hours, deleting an entire partition could take seconds.

### Benefits to queries
Partitioning can also be used to improve query performance.  If a query applies a filter on a partitioned column, this can limit the scan to only the qualifying partitions which may be a much smaller subset of the data, avoiding a full table scan.  With the introduction of clustered columnstore indexes, the predicate elimination performance benefits are less beneficial, but in some cases there can be a benefit to queries.  For example, if the sales fact table is partitioned into 36 months using the sales date field, then queries that filter on the sale date can skip searching in partitions that donâ€™t match the filter.

## Partition sizing guidance
While partitioning can be used to improve performance some scenarios, creating a table with **too many** partitions can hurt performance under some circumstances.  These concerns are especially true for clustered columnstore tables.  For partitioning to be helpful, it is important to understand when to use partitioning and the number of partitions to create.  There is no hard fast rule as to how many partitions are too many, it depends on your data and how many partitions you are loading to simultaneously.  But as a general rule of thumb, think of adding 10s to 100s of partitions, not 1000s.

When creating partitioning on **clustered columnstore** tables, it is important to consider how many rows will land in each partition.  For optimal compression and performance of clustered columnstore tables, a minimum of 1 million rows per distribution and partition is needed.  Before partitions are created, SQL Data Warehouse already divides each table into 60 distributed databases.  Any partitioning added to a table is in addition to the distributions created behind the scenes.  Using this example, if the sales fact table contained 36 monthly partitions, and given that SQL Data Warehouse has 60 distributions, then the sales fact table should contain 60 million rows per month, or 2.1 billion rows when all months are populated.  If a table contains significantly less rows than the recommended minimum number of rows per partition, consider using fewer partitions in order to make increase the number of rows per partition.  Also see the [Indexing](sql-data-warehouse-tables-index.md) article which includes queries that can be run on SQL Data Warehouse to assess the quality of cluster columnstore indexes.

## Syntax difference from SQL Server
SQL Data Warehouse introduces a simplified definition of partitions which is slightly different from SQL Server.  Partitioning functions and schemes are not used in SQL Data Warehouse as they are in SQL Server.  Instead, all you need to do is identify partitioned column and the boundary points.  While the syntax of partitioning may be slightly different from SQL Server, the basic concepts are the same.  SQL Server and SQL Data Warehouse support one partition column per table, which can be ranged partition.  To learn more about partitioning, see [Partitioned Tables and Indexes](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms190787.aspx).

The below example of a SQL Data Warehouse partitioned [CREATE TABLE](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt203953.aspx) statement, partitions the FactInternetSales table on the OrderDateKey column:

```sql
CREATE TABLE [dbo].[FactInternetSales]
(
    [ProductKey]            int          NOT NULL
,   [OrderDateKey]          int          NOT NULL
,   [CustomerKey]           int          NOT NULL
,   [PromotionKey]          int          NOT NULL
,   [SalesOrderNumber]      nvarchar(20) NOT NULL
,   [OrderQuantity]         smallint     NOT NULL
,   [UnitPrice]             money        NOT NULL
,   [SalesAmount]           money        NOT NULL
)
WITH
(   CLUSTERED COLUMNSTORE INDEX
,   DISTRIBUTION = HASH([ProductKey])
,   PARTITION   (   [OrderDateKey] RANGE RIGHT FOR VALUES
                    (20000101,20010101,20020101
                    ,20030101,20040101,20050101
                    )
                )
)
;
```

## Migrating partitioning from SQL Server
To migrate SQL Server partition definitions to SQL Data Warehouse simply:

* Eliminate the SQL Server [partition scheme](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms179854.aspx).
* Add the [partition function](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms187802.aspx) definition to your CREATE TABLE.

If you are migrating a partitioned table from a SQL Server instance the below SQL can help you to interrogate the number of rows that are in each partition.  Keep in mind that if the same partitioning granularity is used on SQL Data Warehouse, the number of rows per partition will decrease by a factor of 60.  

```sql
-- Partition information for a SQL Server Database
SELECT      s.[name]                        AS      [schema_name]
,           t.[name]                        AS      [table_name]
,           i.[name]                        AS      [index_name]
,           p.[partition_number]            AS      [partition_number]
,           SUM(a.[used_pages]*8.0)         AS      [partition_size_kb]
,           SUM(a.[used_pages]*8.0)/1024    AS      [partition_size_mb]
,           SUM(a.[used_pages]*8.0)/1048576 AS      [partition_size_gb]
,           p.[rows]                        AS      [partition_row_count]
,           rv.[value]                      AS      [partition_boundary_value]
,           p.[data_compression_desc]       AS      [partition_compression_desc]
FROM        sys.schemas s
JOIN        sys.tables t                    ON      t.[schema_id]         = s.[schema_id]
JOIN        sys.partitions p                ON      p.[object_id]         = t.[object_id]
JOIN        sys.allocation_units a          ON      a.[container_id]      = p.[partition_id]
JOIN        sys.indexes i                   ON      i.[object_id]         = p.[object_id]
                                            AND     i.[index_id]          = p.[index_id]
JOIN        sys.data_spaces ds              ON      ds.[data_space_id]    = i.[data_space_id]
LEFT JOIN   sys.partition_schemes ps        ON      ps.[data_space_id]    = ds.[data_space_id]
LEFT JOIN   sys.partition_functions pf      ON      pf.[function_id]      = ps.[function_id]
LEFT JOIN   sys.partition_range_values rv   ON      rv.[function_id]      = pf.[function_id]
                                            AND     rv.[boundary_id]      = p.[partition_number]
WHERE       p.[index_id] <=1
GROUP BY    s.[name]
,           t.[name]
,           i.[name]
,           p.[partition_number]
,           p.[rows]
,           rv.[value]
,           p.[data_compression_desc]
;
```

## Workload management
One final piece consideration to factor in to the table partition decision is [workload management](sql-data-warehouse-develop-concurrency.md).  Workload management in SQL Data Warehouse is primarily the management of memory and concurrency.  In SQL Data Warehouse the maximum memory allocated to each distribution during query execution is governed resource classes.  Ideally your partitions will be sized in consideration of other factors like the memory needs of building clustered columnstore indexes.  Clustered columnstore indexes benefit greatly when they are allocated more memory.  Therefore, you will want to ensure that a partition index rebuild is not starved of memory. Increasing the amount of memory available to your query can be achieved by switching from the default role, smallrc, to one of the other roles such as largerc.

Information on the allocation of memory per distribution is available by querying the resource governor dynamic management views. In reality your memory grant will be less than the figures below. However, this provides a level of guidance that you can use when sizing your partitions for data management operations.  Try to avoid sizing your partitions beyond the memory grant provided by the extra large resource class. If your partitions grow beyond this figure you run the risk of memory pressure which in turn leads to less optimal compression.

```sql
SELECT  rp.[name]                                AS [pool_name]
,       rp.[max_memory_kb]                        AS [max_memory_kb]
,       rp.[max_memory_kb]/1024                    AS [max_memory_mb]
,       rp.[max_memory_kb]/1048576                AS [mex_memory_gb]
,       rp.[max_memory_percent]                    AS [max_memory_percent]
,       wg.[name]                                AS [group_name]
,       wg.[importance]                            AS [group_importance]
,       wg.[request_max_memory_grant_percent]    AS [request_max_memory_grant_percent]
FROM    sys.dm_pdw_nodes_resource_governor_workload_groups    wg
JOIN    sys.dm_pdw_nodes_resource_governor_resource_pools    rp ON wg.[pool_id] = rp.[pool_id]
WHERE   wg.[name] like 'SloDWGroup%'
AND     rp.[name]    = 'SloDWPool'
;
```

## Partition switching
SQL Data Warehouse supports partition splitting, merging, and switching. Each of these functions is excuted using the [ALTER TABLE](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms190273.aspx) statement.

To switch partitions between two tables you must ensure that the partitions align on their respective boundaries and that the table definitions match. As check constraints are not available to enforce the range of values in a table the source table must contain the same partition boundaries as the target table. If this is not the case, then the partition switch will fail as the partition metadata will not be synchronized.

### How to split a partition that contains data
The most efficient method to split a partition that already contains data is to use a `CTAS` statement. If the partitioned table is a clustered columnstore then the table partition must be empty before it can be split.

Below is a sample partitioned columnstore table containing one row in each partition:

```sql
CREATE TABLE [dbo].[FactInternetSales]
(
        [ProductKey]            int          NOT NULL
    ,   [OrderDateKey]          int          NOT NULL
    ,   [CustomerKey]           int          NOT NULL
    ,   [PromotionKey]          int          NOT NULL
    ,   [SalesOrderNumber]      nvarchar(20) NOT NULL
    ,   [OrderQuantity]         smallint     NOT NULL
    ,   [UnitPrice]             money        NOT NULL
    ,   [SalesAmount]           money        NOT NULL
)
WITH
(   CLUSTERED COLUMNSTORE INDEX
,   DISTRIBUTION = HASH([ProductKey])
,   PARTITION   (   [OrderDateKey] RANGE RIGHT FOR VALUES
                    (20000101
                    )
                )
)
;

INSERT INTO dbo.FactInternetSales
VALUES (1,19990101,1,1,1,1,1,1);
INSERT INTO dbo.FactInternetSales
VALUES (1,20000101,1,1,1,1,1,1);


CREATE STATISTICS Stat_dbo_FactInternetSales_OrderDateKey ON dbo.FactInternetSales(OrderDateKey);
```

> [!NOTE]
> By Creating the statistic object, we ensure that table metadata is more accurate. If we omit creating statistics, then SQL Data Warehouse will use default values. For details on statistics please review [statistics](sql-data-warehouse-tables-statistics.md).
> 
> 

We can then query for the row count using the `sys.partitions` catalog view:

```sql
SELECT  QUOTENAME(s.[name])+'.'+QUOTENAME(t.[name]) as Table_name
,       i.[name] as Index_name
,       p.partition_number as Partition_nmbr
,       p.[rows] as Row_count
,       p.[data_compression_desc] as Data_Compression_desc
FROM    sys.partitions p
JOIN    sys.tables     t    ON    p.[object_id]   = t.[object_id]
JOIN    sys.schemas    s    ON    t.[schema_id]   = s.[schema_id]
JOIN    sys.indexes    i    ON    p.[object_id]   = i.[object_Id]
                            AND   p.[index_Id]    = i.[index_Id]
WHERE t.[name] = 'FactInternetSales'
;
```

If we try to split this table, we will get an error:

```sql
ALTER TABLE FactInternetSales SPLIT RANGE (20010101);
```

Msg 35346, Level 15, State 1, Line 44
SPLIT clause of ALTER PARTITION statement failed because the partition is not empty.  Only empty partitions can be split in when a columnstore index exists on the table. Consider disabling the columnstore index before issuing the ALTER PARTITION statement, then rebuilding the columnstore index after ALTER PARTITION is complete.

However, we can use `CTAS` to create a new table to hold our data.

```sql
CREATE TABLE dbo.FactInternetSales_20000101
    WITH    (   DISTRIBUTION = HASH(ProductKey)
            ,   CLUSTERED COLUMNSTORE INDEX
            ,   PARTITION   (   [OrderDateKey] RANGE RIGHT FOR VALUES
                                (20000101
                                )
                            )
            )
AS
SELECT *
FROM    FactInternetSales
WHERE   1=2
;
```

As the partition boundaries are aligned a switch is permitted. This will leave the source table with an empty partition that we can subsequently split.

```sql
ALTER TABLE FactInternetSales SWITCH PARTITION 2 TO  FactInternetSales_20000101 PARTITION 2;

ALTER TABLE FactInternetSales SPLIT RANGE (20010101);
```

All that is left to do is to align our data to the new partition boundaries using `CTAS` and switch our data back in to the main table

```sql
CREATE TABLE [dbo].[FactInternetSales_20000101_20010101]
    WITH    (   DISTRIBUTION = HASH([ProductKey])
            ,   CLUSTERED COLUMNSTORE INDEX
            ,   PARTITION   (   [OrderDateKey] RANGE RIGHT FOR VALUES
                                (20000101,20010101
                                )
                            )
            )
AS
SELECT  *
FROM    [dbo].[FactInternetSales_20000101]
WHERE   [OrderDateKey] >= 20000101
AND     [OrderDateKey] <  20010101
;

ALTER TABLE dbo.FactInternetSales_20000101_20010101 SWITCH PARTITION 2 TO dbo.FactInternetSales PARTITION 2;
```

Once you have completed the movement of the data it is a good idea to refresh the statistics on the target table to ensure they accurately reflect the new distribution of the data in their respective partitions:

```sql
UPDATE STATISTICS [dbo].[FactInternetSales];
```

### Table partitioning source control
To avoid your table definition from **rusting** in your source control system you may want to consider the following approach:

1. Create the table as a partitioned table but with no partition values

```sql
CREATE TABLE [dbo].[FactInternetSales]
(
    [ProductKey]            int          NOT NULL
,   [OrderDateKey]          int          NOT NULL
,   [CustomerKey]           int          NOT NULL
,   [PromotionKey]          int          NOT NULL
,   [SalesOrderNumber]      nvarchar(20) NOT NULL
,   [OrderQuantity]         smallint     NOT NULL
,   [UnitPrice]             money        NOT NULL
,   [SalesAmount]           money        NOT NULL
)
WITH
(   CLUSTERED COLUMNSTORE INDEX
,   DISTRIBUTION = HASH([ProductKey])
,   PARTITION   (   [OrderDateKey] RANGE RIGHT FOR VALUES
                    ()
                )
)
;
```

1. `SPLIT` the table as part of the deployment process:

```sql
-- Create a table containing the partition boundaries

CREATE TABLE #partitions
WITH
(
    LOCATION = USER_DB
,   DISTRIBUTION = HASH(ptn_no)
)
AS
SELECT  ptn_no
,       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY (ptn_no)) as seq_no
FROM    (
        SELECT CAST(20000101 AS INT) ptn_no
        UNION ALL
        SELECT CAST(20010101 AS INT)
        UNION ALL
        SELECT CAST(20020101 AS INT)
        UNION ALL
        SELECT CAST(20030101 AS INT)
        UNION ALL
        SELECT CAST(20040101 AS INT)
        ) a
;

-- Iterate over the partition boundaries and split the table

DECLARE @c INT = (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM #partitions)
,       @i INT = 1                                 --iterator for while loop
,       @q NVARCHAR(4000)                          --query
,       @p NVARCHAR(20)     = N''                  --partition_number
,       @s NVARCHAR(128)    = N'dbo'               --schema
,       @t NVARCHAR(128)    = N'FactInternetSales' --table
;

WHILE @i <= @c
BEGIN
    SET @p = (SELECT ptn_no FROM #partitions WHERE seq_no = @i);
    SET @q = (SELECT N'ALTER TABLE '+@s+N'.'+@t+N' SPLIT RANGE ('+@p+N');');

    -- PRINT @q;
    EXECUTE sp_executesql @q;

    SET @i+=1;
END

-- Code clean-up

DROP TABLE #partitions;
```

With this approach the code in source control remains static and the partitioning boundary values are allowed to be dynamic; evolving with the warehouse over time.
