Getting started with creating tables in SQL Data Warehouse is simple.  The basic [CREATE TABLE](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt203953.aspx) syntax follows the common syntax you are most likely already familiar with from working with other databases.  To create a table, you simply need to name your table, name your columns and define data types for each column.  If you've create tables in other databases, this should look very familiar to you.

```sql  
CREATE TABLE Customers (FirstName VARCHAR(25), LastName VARCHAR(25))
 ``` 

The above example creates a table named Customers with two columns, FirstName and LastName.  Each column is defined with a data type of VARCHAR(25), which limits the data to 25 characters.  These fundamental attributes of a table, as well as others, are mostly the same as other databases.  Data types are defined for each column and ensure the integrity of your data.  Indexes can be added to improve performance by reducing I/O.  Partitioning can be added to improve performance when you need to modify data.

[Renaming](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt631611.aspx) a SQL Data Warehouse table looks like this:

```sql  
RENAME OBJECT Customer TO CustomerOrig; 
 ```

## Distributed tables
A new fundamental attribute introduced by distributed systems like SQL Data Warehouse is the **distribution column**.  The distribution column is very much what it sounds like.  It is the column that determines how to distribute, or divide, your data behind the scenes.  When you create a table without specifying the distribution column, the table is automatically distributed using **round robin**.  While round robin tables can be sufficient in some scenarios, defining distribution columns can greatly reduce data movement during queries, thus optimizing performance.  See [Distributing a Table](sql-data-warehouse-tables-distribute.md) to learn more about how to select a distribution column.

## Indexing and partitioning tables
As you become more advanced in using SQL Data Warehouse and want to optimize performance, you'll want to learn more about Table Design.  To learn more, see the articles on [Table Data Types](sql-data-warehouse-tables-data-types.md), [Distributing a Table](sql-data-warehouse-tables-distribute.md), [Indexing a Table](sql-data-warehouse-tables-index.md) and  [Partitioning a Table](sql-data-warehouse-tables-partition.md).

## Table statistics
Statistics are an extremely important to getting the best performance out of your SQL Data Warehouse.  Since SQL Data Warehouse does not yet automatically create and update statistics for you, like you may have come to expect in Azure SQL Database, reading our article on [Statistics](sql-data-warehouse-tables-statistics.md) might be one of the most important articles you read to ensure that you get the best performance from your queries.

## Temporary tables
Temporary tables are tables which only exist for the duration of your logon and cannot be seen by other users.  Temporary tables can be a good way to prevent others from seeing temporary results and also reduce the need for cleanup.  Since temporary tables also utilize local storage, they can offer faster performance for some operations.  See the [Temporary Table](sql-data-warehouse-tables-temporary.md) articles for more details about temporary tables.

## External tables
External tables, also known as Polybase tables, are tables which can be queried from SQL Data Warehouse, but point to data external from SQL Data Warehouse.  For example, you can create an external table which points to files on Azure Blob Storage.  For more details on how to create and query an external table, see [Load data with Polybase](sql-data-warehouse-load-from-azure-blob-storage-with-polybase.md).  

## Unsupported table features
While SQL Data Warehouse contains many of the same table features offered by other databases, there are some features which are not yet supported.  Below is a list of some of the table features which are not yet supported.

| Unsupported features |
| --- |
| [Identity Property](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms186775.aspx) (see [Assigning Surrogate Key Workaround](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/sqlcat/2016/02/18/assigning-surrogate-key-to-dimension-tables-in-sql-dw-and-aps/)) |
| Primary key, Foreign keys, Unique and Check [Table Constraints](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms188066.aspx) |
| [Unique Indexes](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms188783.aspx) |
| [Computed Columns](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms186241.aspx) |
| [Sparse Columns](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/cc280604.aspx) |
| [User-Defined Types](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms131694.aspx) |
| [Sequence](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ff878091.aspx) |
| [Triggers](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms189799.aspx) |
| [Indexed Views](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms191432.aspx) |
| [Synonyms](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms177544.aspx) |

## Table size queries
One simple way to identify space and rows consumed by a table in each of the 60 distributions, is to use [DBCC PDW_SHOWSPACEUSED](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt204028.aspx).

```sql
DBCC PDW_SHOWSPACEUSED('dbo.FactInternetSales');
```

However, using DBCC commands can be quite limiting.  Dynamic management views (DMVs) will allow you to see much more detail as well as give you much greater control over the query results.  Start by creating this view, which will be referred to by many of our examples in this and other articles.

```sql
CREATE VIEW dbo.vTableSizes
AS

AS
(

 GETDATE()                                                             AS  [execution_time]

### Table space summary
This query returns the rows and space by table.  It is a great query to see which tables are your largest tables and whether they are round robin or hash distributed.  For hash distributed tables it also shows the distribution column.  In most cases your largest tables should be hash distributed with a clustered columnstore index.

```sql
SELECT 
     database_name
,    schema_name
,    table_name
,    distribution_policy_name
,      distribution_column
,    index_type_desc
,    COUNT(distinct partition_nmbr) as nbr_partitions
,    SUM(row_count)                 as table_row_count
,    SUM(reserved_space_GB)         as table_reserved_space_GB
,    SUM(data_space_GB)             as table_data_space_GB
,    SUM(index_space_GB)            as table_index_space_GB
,    SUM(unused_space_GB)           as table_unused_space_GB
FROM 
    dbo.vTableSizes
GROUP BY 
     database_name
,    schema_name
,    table_name
,    distribution_policy_name
,      distribution_column
,    index_type_desc
ORDER BY
    table_reserved_space_GB desc
;
```

### Table space by distribution type
```sql
SELECT 
     distribution_policy_name
,    SUM(row_count)                as table_type_row_count
,    SUM(reserved_space_GB)        as table_type_reserved_space_GB
,    SUM(data_space_GB)            as table_type_data_space_GB
,    SUM(index_space_GB)           as table_type_index_space_GB
,    SUM(unused_space_GB)          as table_type_unused_space_GB
FROM dbo.vTableSizes
GROUP BY distribution_policy_name
;
```

### Table space by index type
```sql
SELECT 
     index_type_desc
,    SUM(row_count)                as table_type_row_count
,    SUM(reserved_space_GB)        as table_type_reserved_space_GB
,    SUM(data_space_GB)            as table_type_data_space_GB
,    SUM(index_space_GB)           as table_type_index_space_GB
,    SUM(unused_space_GB)          as table_type_unused_space_GB
FROM dbo.vTableSizes
GROUP BY index_type_desc
;
```

### Distribution space summary
```sql
SELECT 
    distribution_id
,    SUM(row_count)                as total_node_distribution_row_count
,    SUM(reserved_space_MB)        as total_node_distribution_reserved_space_MB
,    SUM(data_space_MB)            as total_node_distribution_data_space_MB
,    SUM(index_space_MB)           as total_node_distribution_index_space_MB
,    SUM(unused_space_MB)          as total_node_distribution_unused_space_MB
FROM dbo.vTableSizes
GROUP BY     distribution_id
ORDER BY    distribution_id
;
```
