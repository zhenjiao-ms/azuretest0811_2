# Link a virtual network to an ExpressRoute circuit

This article will help you link virtual networks (VNets) to Azure ExpressRoute circuits by using the Resource Manager deployment model and PowerShell. Virtual networks can either be in the same subscription or part of another subscription.

**About Azure deployment models**

[!INCLUDE [vpn-gateway-clasic-rm](../../includes/vpn-gateway-classic-rm-include.md)]

## Configuration prerequisites
* You need the latest version of the Azure PowerShell modules (at least version 1.0). See [How to install and configure Azure PowerShell](../powershell-install-configure.md) for more information about installing the PowerShell cmdlets.
* You need to review the [prerequisites](expressroute-prerequisites.md), [routing requirements](expressroute-routing.md), and [workflows](expressroute-workflows.md) before you begin configuration.
* You must have an active ExpressRoute circuit. 
  * Follow the instructions to [create an ExpressRoute circuit](expressroute-howto-circuit-arm.md) and have the circuit enabled by your connectivity provider. 
  * Ensure that you have Azure private peering configured for your circuit. See the [configure routing](expressroute-howto-routing-arm.md) article for routing instructions. 
  * Ensure that Azure private peering is configured and the BGP peering between your network and Microsoft is up so that you can enable end-to-end connectivity.
  * Ensure that you have a virtual network and a virtual network gateway created and fully provisioned. Follow the instructions to create a [VPN gateway](../vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-create-site-to-site-rm-powershell.md), but be sure to use `-GatewayType ExpressRoute`.

You can link up to 10 virtual networks to an ExpressRoute circuit. All virtual networks must be in the same geopolitical region. You can link a larger number of virtual networks to your ExpressRoute circuit, or link virtual networks that are in other geopolitical regions if you enabled the ExpressRoute premium add-on. Check the [FAQ](expressroute-faqs.md) for more details about the premium add-on.

## Connect a virtual network in the same subscription to a circuit
You can connect a virtual network gateway to an ExpressRoute circuit by using the following cmdlet. Make sure that the virtual network gateway is created and is ready for linking before you run the cmdlet:

    $circuit = Get-AzureRmExpressRouteCircuit -Name "MyCircuit" -ResourceGroupName "MyRG"
    $gw = Get-AzureRmVirtualNetworkGateway -Name "ExpressRouteGw" -ResourceGroupName "MyRG"
    $connection = New-AzureRmVirtualNetworkGatewayConnection -Name "ERConnection" -ResourceGroupName "MyRG" -Location "East US" -VirtualNetworkGateway1 $gw -PeerId $circuit.Id -ConnectionType ExpressRoute

## Connect a virtual network in a different subscription to a circuit
You can share an ExpressRoute circuit across multiple subscriptions. The following figure shows a simple schematic of how sharing works for ExpressRoute circuits across multiple subscriptions.

Each of the smaller clouds within the large cloud is used to represent subscriptions that belong to different departments within an organization. Each of the departments within the organization can use their own subscription for deploying their services--but they can share a single ExpressRoute circuit to connect back to your on-premises network. A single department (in this example: IT) can own the ExpressRoute circuit. Other subscriptions within the organization can use the ExpressRoute circuit.

> [!NOTE]
> Connectivity and bandwidth charges for the dedicated circuit will be applied to the ExpressRoute circuit owner. All virtual networks share the same bandwidth.

### Administration
The *circuit owner* is an authorized power user of the ExpressRoute circuit resource. The circuit owner can create authorizations that can be redeemed by *circuit users*. *Circuit users* are owners of virtual network gateways (that are not within the same subscription as the ExpressRoute circuit). *Circuit users* can redeem authorizations (one authorization per virtual network).

The *circuit owner* has the power to modify and revoke authorizations at any time. Revoking an authorization results in all link connections being deleted from the subscription whose access was revoked.

### Circuit owner operations
#### Creating an authorization
The circuit owner creates an authorization. This results in the creation of an authorization key that can be used by a circuit user to connect their virtual network gateways to the ExpressRoute circuit. An authorization is valid for only one connection.

The following cmdlet snippet shows how to create an authorization:

    $circuit = Get-AzureRmExpressRouteCircuit -Name "MyCircuit" -ResourceGroupName "MyRG"
    Add-AzureRmExpressRouteCircuitAuthorization -ExpressRouteCircuit $circuit -Name "MyAuthorization1"
    Set-AzureRmExpressRouteCircuit -ExpressRouteCircuit $circuit

    $auth1 = Get-AzureRmExpressRouteCircuitAuthorization -ExpressRouteCircuit $circuit -Name "MyAuthorization1"


The response to this will contain the authorization key and status:

    Name                   : MyAuthorization1
    Id                     : /subscriptions/&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&/resourceGroups/ERCrossSubTestRG/providers/Microsoft.Network/expressRouteCircuits/CrossSubTest/authorizations/MyAuthorization1
    Etag                   : &&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&& 
    AuthorizationKey       : ####################################
    AuthorizationUseStatus : Available
    ProvisioningState      : Succeeded



#### Reviewing authorizations
The circuit owner can review all authorizations that are issued on a particular circuit by running the following cmdlet:

    $circuit = Get-AzureRmExpressRouteCircuit -Name "MyCircuit" -ResourceGroupName "MyRG"
    $authorizations = Get-AzureRmExpressRouteCircuitAuthorization -ExpressRouteCircuit $circuit


#### Adding authorizations
The circuit owner can add authorizations by using the following cmdlet:

    $circuit = Get-AzureRmExpressRouteCircuit -Name "MyCircuit" -ResourceGroupName "MyRG"
    Add-AzureRmExpressRouteCircuitAuthorization -ExpressRouteCircuit $circuit -Name "MyAuthorization2"
    Set-AzureRmExpressRouteCircuit -ExpressRouteCircuit $circuit

    $circuit = Get-AzureRmExpressRouteCircuit -Name "MyCircuit" -ResourceGroupName "MyRG"
    $authorizations = Get-AzureRmExpressRouteCircuitAuthorization -ExpressRouteCircuit $circuit


#### Deleting authorizations
The circuit owner can revoke/delete authorizations to the user by running the following cmdlet:

    Remove-AzureRmExpressRouteCircuitAuthorization -Name "MyAuthorization2" -ExpressRouteCircuit $circuit
    Set-AzureRmExpressRouteCircuit -ExpressRouteCircuit $circuit    

### Circuit user operations
The circuit user needs the peer ID and an authorization key from the circuit owner. The authorization key is a GUID.

#### Redeeming connection authorizations
The circuit user can run the following cmdlet to redeem a link authorization:

    $id = "/subscriptions/********************************/resourceGroups/ERCrossSubTestRG/providers/Microsoft.Network/expressRouteCircuits/MyCircuit"    
    $connection = New-AzureRmVirtualNetworkGatewayConnection -Name "ERConnection" -ResourceGroupName "RemoteResourceGroup" -Location "East US" -VirtualNetworkGateway1 $gw -PeerId $id -ConnectionType ExpressRoute -AuthorizationKey "^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^"

#### Releasing connection authorizations
You can release an authorization by deleting the connection that links the ExpressRoute circuit to the virtual network.
