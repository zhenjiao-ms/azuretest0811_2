## Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) and ARP tables
Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a layer 2 protocol defined in [RFC 826](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc826). ARP is used to map the Ethernet address (MAC address) with an ip address.

The ARP table provides a mapping of the ipv4 address and MAC address for a particular peering. The ARP table for an ExpressRoute circuit peering provides the following information for each interface (primary and secondary)

1. Mapping of on-premises router interface ip address to the MAC address
2. Mapping of ExpressRoute router interface ip address to the MAC address
3. Age of the mapping

ARP tables can help validate layer 2 configuration and troubleshooting basic layer 2 connectivity issues. 

Example ARP table: 

        Age InterfaceProperty IpAddress  MacAddress    
        --- ----------------- ---------  ----------    
         10 On-Prem           10.0.0.1 ffff.eeee.dddd
          0 Microsoft         10.0.0.2 aaaa.bbbb.cccc


The following section provides information on how you can view the ARP tables seen by the ExpressRoute edge routers. 

## Prerequisites for learning ARP tables
Ensure that you have the following before you progress further

* A Valid ExpressRoute circuit configured with at least one peering. The circuit must be fully configured by the connectivity provider. You (or your connectivity provider) must have configured at least one of the peerings (Azure private, Azure public and Microsoft) on this circuit.
* IP address ranges used for configuring the peerings (Azure private, Azure public and Microsoft). Review the ip address assignment examples in the [ExpressRoute routing requirements page](expressroute-routing.md) to get an understanding of how ip addresses are mapped to interfaces on your aise and on the ExpressRoute side. You can get information on the peering configuration by reviewing the [ExpressRoute peering configuration page](expressroute-howto-routing-arm.md).
* Information from your networking team / connectivity provider on the MAC addresses of interfaces used with these IP addresses.
* You must have the latest PowerShell module for Azure (version 1.50 or newer).

## Getting the ARP tables for your ExpressRoute circuit
This section provides instructions on how you can view the ARP tables per peering using PowerShell. You or your connectivity provider must have configured the peering before progressing further. Each circuit has two paths (primary and secondary). You can check the ARP table for each path independently.

### ARP tables for Azure private peering
The following cmdlet provides the ARP tables for Azure private peering

        # Required Variables
        $RG = "<Your Resource Group Name Here>"
        $Name = "<Your ExpressRoute Circuit Name Here>"

        # ARP table for Azure private peering - Primary path
        Get-AzureRmExpressRouteCircuitARPTable -ResourceGroupName $RG -ExpressRouteCircuitName $Name -PeeringType AzurePrivatePeering -DevicePath Primary

        # ARP table for Azure private peering - Secodary path
        Get-AzureRmExpressRouteCircuitARPTable -ResourceGroupName $RG -ExpressRouteCircuitName $Name -PeeringType AzurePrivatePeering -DevicePath Secondary 

Sample output is shown below for one of the paths

        Age InterfaceProperty IpAddress  MacAddress    
        --- ----------------- ---------  ----------    
         10 On-Prem           10.0.0.1 ffff.eeee.dddd
          0 Microsoft         10.0.0.2 aaaa.bbbb.cccc


### ARP tables for Azure public peering
The following cmdlet provides the ARP tables for Azure public peering

        # Required Variables
        $RG = "<Your Resource Group Name Here>"
        $Name = "<Your ExpressRoute Circuit Name Here>"

        # ARP table for Azure public peering - Primary path
        Get-AzureRmExpressRouteCircuitARPTable -ResourceGroupName $RG -ExpressRouteCircuitName $Name -PeeringType AzurePublicPeering -DevicePath Primary

        # ARP table for Azure public peering - Secodary path
        Get-AzureRmExpressRouteCircuitARPTable -ResourceGroupName $RG -ExpressRouteCircuitName $Name -PeeringType AzurePublicPeering -DevicePath Secondary 


Sample output is shown below for one of the paths

        Age InterfaceProperty IpAddress  MacAddress    
        --- ----------------- ---------  ----------    
         10 On-Prem           64.0.0.1 ffff.eeee.dddd
          0 Microsoft         64.0.0.2 aaaa.bbbb.cccc


### ARP tables for Microsoft peering
The following cmdlet provides the ARP tables for Microsoft peering

        # Required Variables
        $RG = "<Your Resource Group Name Here>"
        $Name = "<Your ExpressRoute Circuit Name Here>"

        # ARP table for Microsoft peering - Primary path
        Get-AzureRmExpressRouteCircuitARPTable -ResourceGroupName $RG -ExpressRouteCircuitName $Name -PeeringType MicrosoftPeering -DevicePath Primary

        # ARP table for Microsoft peering - Secodary path
        Get-AzureRmExpressRouteCircuitARPTable -ResourceGroupName $RG -ExpressRouteCircuitName $Name -PeeringType MicrosoftPeering -DevicePath Secondary 


Sample output is shown below for one of the paths

        Age InterfaceProperty IpAddress  MacAddress    
        --- ----------------- ---------  ----------    
         10 On-Prem           65.0.0.1 ffff.eeee.dddd
          0 Microsoft         65.0.0.2 aaaa.bbbb.cccc


## How to use this information
The ARP table of a peering can be used to determine validate layer 2 configuration and connectivity. This section provides an overview of how ARP tables will look under different scenarios.

### ARP table when a circuit is in operational state (expected state)
* The ARP table will have an entry for the on-premises side with a valid IP address and MAC address and a similar entry for the Microsoft side. 
* The last octet of the on-premises ip address will always be an odd number.
* The last octet of the Microsoft ip address will always be an even number.
* The same MAC address will appear on the Microsoft side for all 3 peerings (primary / secondary). 

        Age InterfaceProperty IpAddress  MacAddress    
        --- ----------------- ---------  ----------    
         10 On-Prem           65.0.0.1 ffff.eeee.dddd
          0 Microsoft         65.0.0.2 aaaa.bbbb.cccc

### ARP table when on-premises / connectivity provider side has problems
* Only one entry will appear int he ARP table. This will show the mapping between the MAC address and IP address used in the Microsoft side. 
  
       Age InterfaceProperty IpAddress  MacAddress    
       --- ----------------- ---------  ----------    
         0 Microsoft         65.0.0.2 aaaa.bbbb.cccc

> [!NOTE]
> Open a support request with your connectivity provider to debug such issues. 
> 
> 

### ARP table when Microsoft side has problems
* You will not see an ARP table shown for a peering if there are issues on the Microsoft side. 
* Open a support ticket with [Microsoft support](https://portal.azure.com/?#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade). Specify that you have an issue with layer 2 connectivity. 

## Next Steps
* Validate Layer 3 configurations for your ExpressRoute circuit
  * Get route summary to determine the state of BGP sessions 
  * Get route table to determine which prefixes are advertised across ExpressRoute
* Validate data transfer by reviewing bytes in / out
* Open a support ticket with [Microsoft support](https://portal.azure.com/?#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade) if you are still experiencing issues.
