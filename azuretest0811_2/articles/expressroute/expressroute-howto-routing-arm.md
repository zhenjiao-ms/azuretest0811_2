This article walks you through the steps to create and manage routing configuration for an ExpressRoute circuit using PowerShell and the Azure Resource Manager deployment model.  The steps below will also show you how to check the status, update, or delete and deprovision peerings for an ExpressRoute circuit. 

**About Azure deployment models**

[!INCLUDE [vpn-gateway-clasic-rm](../../includes/vpn-gateway-classic-rm-include.md)]

## Configuration prerequisites
* You will need the latest version of the Azure PowerShell modules, version 1.0 or later. 
* Make sure that you have reviewed the [prerequisites](expressroute-prerequisites.md) page, the [routing requirements](expressroute-routing.md) page, and the [workflows](expressroute-workflows.md) page before you begin configuration.
* You must have an active ExpressRoute circuit. Follow the instructions to [Create an ExpressRoute circuit](expressroute-howto-circuit-arm.md) and have the circuit enabled by your connectivity provider before you proceed. The ExpressRoute circuit must be in a provisioned and enabled state for you to be able to run the cmdlets described below.

These instructions only apply to circuits created with service providers offering Layer 2 connectivity services. If you are using a service provider offering managed Layer 3 services (typically an IPVPN, like MPLS), your connectivity provider will configure and manage routing for you.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We currently do not advertise peerings configured by service providers through the service management portal. We are working on enabling this capability soon. Please check with your service provider before configuring BGP peerings.
> 
> 

You can configure one, two, or all three peerings (Azure private, Azure public and Microsoft) for an ExpressRoute circuit. You can configure peerings in any order you choose. However, you must make sure that you complete the configuration of each peering one at a time. 

## Azure private peering
This section provides instructions on how to create, get, update, and delete the Azure private peering configuration for an ExpressRoute circuit. 

### To create Azure private peering
1. Import the PowerShell module for ExpressRoute.
   
     You must install the latest PowerShell installer from [PowerShell Gallery](http://www.powershellgallery.com/) and import the Azure Resource Manager modules into the PowerShell session in order to start using the ExpressRoute cmdlets. You will need to run PowerShell as an Administrator.
   
        Install-Module AzureRM
   
        Install-AzureRM
   
    Import all of the AzureRM.* modules within the known semantic version range
   
        Import-AzureRM
   
    You can also just import a select module within the known semantic version range 
   
        Import-Module AzureRM.Network 
   
    Logon to your account
   
        Login-AzureRmAccount
   
    Select the subscription you want to create ExpressRoute circuit
   
        Select-AzureRmSubscription -SubscriptionId "<subscription ID>"
2. Create an ExpressRoute circuit.
   
    Follow the instructions to create an [ExpressRoute circuit](expressroute-howto-circuit-arm.md) and have it provisioned by the connectivity provider. 
   
    If your connectivity provider offers managed Layer 3 services, you can request your connectivity provider to enable Azure private peering for you. In that case, you won't need to follow instructions listed in the next sections. However, if your connectivity provider does not manage routing for you, after creating your circuit, follow the instructions below. 
3. Check the ExpressRoute circuit to ensure it is provisioned.
   
    You must first check to see if the ExpressRoute circuit is Provisioned and also Enabled. See the example below.
   
        Get-AzureRmExpressRouteCircuit -Name "ExpressRouteARMCircuit" -ResourceGroupName "ExpressRouteResourceGroup"
   
    The response will be something similar to the example below:
   
        Name                             : ExpressRouteARMCircuit
        ResourceGroupName                : ExpressRouteResourceGroup
        Location                         : westus
        Id                               : /subscriptions/***************************/resourceGroups/ExpressRouteResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Network/expressRouteCircuits/ExpressRouteARMCircuit
        Etag                             : W/"################################"
        ProvisioningState                : Succeeded
        Sku                              : {
                                             "Name": "Standard_MeteredData",
                                             "Tier": "Standard",
                                             "Family": "MeteredData"
                                           }
        CircuitProvisioningState         : Enabled
        ServiceProviderProvisioningState : Provisioned
        ServiceProviderNotes             : 
        ServiceProviderProperties        : {
                                             "ServiceProviderName": "Equinix",
                                             "PeeringLocation": "Silicon Valley",
                                             "BandwidthInMbps": 200
                                           }
        ServiceKey                       : **************************************
        Peerings                         : []
4. Configure Azure private peering for the circuit.
   
    Make sure that you have the following items before you proceed with the next steps:
   
   * A /30 subnet for the primary link. This must not be part of any address space reserved for virtual networks.
   * A /30 subnet for the secondary link. This must not be part of any address space reserved for virtual networks.
   * A valid VLAN ID to establish this peering on. Ensure that no other peering in the circuit uses the same VLAN ID.
   * AS number for peering. You can use both 2-byte and 4-byte AS numbers. You can use a private AS number for this peering. Ensure that you are not using 65515.
   * An MD5 hash if you choose to use one. **This is optional**.
     
     You can run the following cmdlet to configure Azure private peering for your circuit.
     
       Add-AzureRmExpressRouteCircuitPeeringConfig -Name "AzurePrivatePeering" -Circuit $ckt -PeeringType AzurePrivatePeering -PeerASN 100 -PrimaryPeerAddressPrefix "10.0.0.0/30" -SecondaryPeerAddressPrefix "10.0.0.4/30" -VlanId 200
     
       Set-AzureRmExpressRouteCircuit -ExpressRouteCircuit $ckt
     
     You can use the cmdlet below if you choose to use an MD5 hash.
     
       Add-AzureRmExpressRouteCircuitPeeringConfig -Name "AzurePrivatePeering" -Circuit $ckt -PeeringType AzurePrivatePeering -PeerASN 100 -PrimaryPeerAddressPrefix "10.0.0.0/30" -SecondaryPeerAddressPrefix "10.0.0.4/30" -VlanId 200  -SharedKey "A1B2C3D4"
     
       Set-AzureRmExpressRouteCircuit -ExpressRouteCircuit $ckt
     
     > [!IMPORTANT]
     > Ensure that you specify your AS number as peering ASN, not customer ASN.
     > 
     > 

### To view Azure private peering details
You can get configuration details using the following cmdlet

        $ckt = Get-AzureRmExpressRouteCircuit -Name "ExpressRouteARMCircuit" -ResourceGroupName "ExpressRouteResourceGroup"

        Get-AzureRmExpressRouteCircuitPeeringConfig -Name "AzurePrivatePeering" -Circuit $ckt    


### To update Azure private peering configuration
You can update any part of the configuration using the following cmdlet. In the example below, the VLAN ID of the circuit is being updated from 100 to 500.

    Set-AzureRmExpressRouteCircuitPeeringConfig -Name "AzurePrivatePeering" -Circuit $ckt -PeeringType AzurePrivatePeering -PeerASN 100 -PrimaryPeerAddressPrefix "10.0.0.0/30" -SecondaryPeerAddressPrefix "10.0.0.4/30" -VlanId 200

    Set-AzureRmExpressRouteCircuit -ExpressRouteCircuit $ckt


### To delete Azure private peering
You can remove your peering configuration by running the following cmdlet.

> [!WARNING]
> You must ensure that all virtual networks are unlinked from the ExpressRoute circuit before running this cmdlet.

    Remove-AzureRmExpressRouteCircuitPeeringConfig -Name "AzurePrivatePeering" -Circuit $ckt
    Set-AzureRmExpressRouteCircuit -ExpressRouteCircuit $ckt



## Azure public peering
This section provides instructions on how to create, get, update and delete the Azure public peering configuration for an ExpressRoute circuit.

### To create Azure public peering
1. Import the PowerShell module for ExpressRoute.
   
     You must install the latest PowerShell installer from [PowerShell Gallery](http://www.powershellgallery.com/) and import the Azure Resource Manager modules into the PowerShell session in order to start using the ExpressRoute cmdlets. You will need to run PowerShell as an Administrator.
   
        Install-Module AzureRM
   
        Install-AzureRM
   
    Import all of the AzureRM.* modules within the known semantic version range
   
        Import-AzureRM
   
    You can also just import a select module within the known semantic version range 
   
        Import-Module AzureRM.Network 
   
    Logon to your account
   
        Login-AzureRmAccount
   
    Select the subscription you want to create ExpressRoute circuit
   
        Select-AzureRmSubscription -SubscriptionId "<subscription ID>"
2. Create an ExpressRoute circuit.
   
    Follow the instructions to create an [ExpressRoute circuit](expressroute-howto-circuit-arm.md) and have it provisioned by the connectivity provider. 
   
    If your connectivity provider offers managed Layer 3 services, you can request your connectivity provider to enable Azure public peering for you. In that case, you won't need to follow instructions listed in the next sections. However, if your connectivity provider does not manage routing for you, after creating your circuit, follow the instructions below.
3. Check ExpressRoute circuit to ensure it is provisioned.
   
    You must first check to see if the ExpressRoute circuit is Provisioned and also Enabled. See the example below.
   
        Get-AzureRmExpressRouteCircuit -Name "ExpressRouteARMCircuit" -ResourceGroupName "ExpressRouteResourceGroup"
   
    The response will be something similar to the example below:
   
        Name                             : ExpressRouteARMCircuit
