## Remarks
For a complete explanation of how to use the script to create Dev and Test environments, see [Using Windows PowerShell Scripts to Publish to Dev and Test Environments](vs-azure-tools-publishing-using-powershell-scripts.md).

The JSON configuration file specifies the details of what is to be deployed. It includes the information that you specified when you created the project, such as the name, affinity group, VHD image, and size of the virtual machine. It also includes the endpoints on the virtual machine, the databases to provision, if any, and web deployment parameters. The following code shows an example JSON configuration file:

```

                    },
                    {

                    }
                ]
            }
        },
        "databases": [
            {
                "connectionStringName": "",
                "databaseName": "",
                "serverName": "",
                "user": "",
                "password": ""
            }
        ],
        "webDeployParameters": {
            "iisWebApplicationName": "Default Web Site"
        }
    }
}
```

You can edit the JSON configuration file to change what is provisioned. A virtual machine and a cloud service are required, but the database section is optional.
