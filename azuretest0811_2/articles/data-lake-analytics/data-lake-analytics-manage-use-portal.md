# Manage Azure Data Lake Analytics using Azure Portal
[!INCLUDE [manage-selector](../../includes/data-lake-analytics-selector-manage.md)]

Learn how to manage Azure Data Lake Analytics accounts, data sources, users, and jobs using the Azure Portal. To see management topics using other tools, click the tab selector above.

**Prerequisites**

Before you begin this tutorial, you must have the following:

* **An Azure subscription**. See [Get Azure free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

<!-- ################################ -->
<!-- ################################ -->
## Manage accounts
Before running any Data Lake Analytics jobs, you must have a Data Lake Analytics account. Unlike Azure HDInsight, you don't pay for an Analytics account when it is not 
running a job.  You only pay for the time when it is running a job.  For more information, see 
[Azure Data Lake Analytics Overview](data-lake-analytics-overview.md).  

**To create a Data Lake Analytics accounts**

1. Sign on to the new [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Click **New**, click **Data + Analytics**, and then click **Data Lake Analytics**.
3. Type or select the following:
   
    ![Azure Data Lake Analytics portal blade](./media/data-lake-analytics-get-started-portal/data-lake-analytics-portal-create-adla.png)
   
   * **Name**: Name the Analytics account.
   * **Data Lake Store**: Each Data Lake Analytics account has a dependent Azure Data Lake Store account. The Data Lake Analytics account and the dependent Data Lake Store account must be located in the same Azure data center. Follow the instruction to create a new Data Lake Store account, or select an existing one.
   * **Subscription**: Choose the Azure subscription used for the Analytics account.
   * **Resource Group**. Select an existing Azure Resource Group or create a new one. Azure Resource Manager (ARM) enables you to work with the resources in your application as a group. For more information, see [Azure Resource Manager Overview](../resource-group-overview.md). 
   * **Location**. Select an Azure data center for the Data Lake Analytics account. 
4. Click **Create**. It takes you to the portal home screen. A new tile is added to the StartBoard with the label showing "Deploying Azure Data Lake Analytics". It takes a few moments to create a Data Lake Analytics account. When the account is created, the portal opens the account on a new blade.
   
    ![Azure Data Lake Analytics portal blade](./media/data-lake-analytics-get-started-portal/data-lake-analytics-portal-blade.png)

<a name="access-adla-account"></a> **To access/open a Data Lake Analytics account**

1. Sign on to the new [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
2. Click **Browse** on the left menu, and then click **Data Lake Analytics**.
3. Click the Data Lake Analytics account that you want to access. It will open the account in a new blade.

**To delete a Data Lake Analytics account**

1. Open the Data Lake Analytics account that you want to delete. For instructions see [Access Data Lake Analytics accounts](#access-adla-account).
2. Click **Delete** from the button menu on the top of the blade.
3. Type the account name, and then click **Delete**.

Delete a Analytics account will not delete the dependent Data Lake Store account. For instructions of deleting
Data Lake Storage accounts, see [Delete Data Lake Store account](../data-lake-store/data-lake-store-get-started-portal.md#delete-azure-data-lake-store-account).

<!-- ################################ -->
<!-- ################################ -->
## Manage account data sources
Data Lake Analytics currently supports the following data sources:

* [Azure Data Lake Store](../data-lake-store/data-lake-store-overview.md)
* [Azure Storage](../storage/storage-introduction.md)

When you create a Data Lake Analytics account, you must designate an Azure Data Lake Store account to be the default 
storage account. The default Data Lake Store account is used to store job metadata and job audit logs. After you have 
created a Data Lake Analytics account, you can add additional Data Lake Store accounts and/or Azure Storage account. 

<a name="default-adl-account"></a>**To find the default Data Lake storage account**

* Open the Data Lake Analytics account that you want to manage. For instructions see [Access Data Lake Analytics accounts](#access-adla-account). The default Data Lake store is shown in **Essential**:
  
    ![Azure Data Lake Analytics add data source](./media/data-lake-analytics-manage-use-portal/data-lake-analytics-default-adl-storage-account.png)

**To add additional data sources**

1. Open the Data Lake Analytics account that you want to manage. For instructions see [Access Data Lake Analytics accounts](#access-adla-account).
2. Click **Settings** and then click **Data Sources**. You shall see the default Data Lake Store account listed
   there. 
3. Click **Add Data Source**.
   
    ![Azure Data Lake Analytics add data source](./media/data-lake-analytics-manage-use-portal/data-lake-analytics-add-data-source.png)
   
    To add a Azure Data Lake Store account, you need the account name, and access to the account to be able query it.
    To add a Azure Blob storage, you need the storage account and the account key, which can be found by navigating to the storage account in the portal.

## Manage users
Data Lake Analytics uses role-based access control with Azure Active Directory. When you create a Data Lake Analytics 
account, a "Subscription Admins" role is added to the account. You can add additional users and security groups with 
the following roles:

| Role | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Owner |Let you manage everything, including access to resources. |
| Contributor |Access the portal; submit and monitor jobs. To be able to submit jobs, a contributor also need the read or write permission to the Data Lake Store accounts. |
| DataLakeAnalyticsDeveloper |User can submit jobs, monitor all jobs, but can only cancel their own jobs. They cannot manage their own account, for instance, add users, change permissions or delete the account. To be able to run jobs, they need read or write access to the Data Lake Store accounts |
| Reader |Lets you view everything, but not make any changes. |
| DevTest Labs User |Lets you view everything, and connect, start, restart, and shutdown virtual machines. |
| User Access Administrator |Lets you manage user access to Azure resources. |

For information on creating Azure Active Directory users and security groups, See [What is Azure Active Directory](../active-directory/active-directory-whatis.md).

**To add users or security groups to an Analytics account**

1. Open the Analytics account that you want to manage. For instructions see [Access Data Lake Analytics accounts](#access-adla-account).
2. Click **Settings**, and then click **Users**. You can also click **Access** on the **Essentials** title bar as shown in the following screenshot:
   
    ![Azure Data Lake Analytics account add users](./media/data-lake-analytics-manage-use-portal/data-lake-analytics-access-button.png)
3. From the **User** blade, click **Add**.
4. Select a role and add a user, and then click **OK**.

**Note: If this user or security group needs to submit jobs, they will need to be given permission on the Data Lake Store as well. For more details, see [Secure data stored in Data Lake Store](../data-lake-store/data-lake-store-secure-data.md).**

## Use Azure Resource Manager groups
Applications are typically made up of many components, for example a web app, database, database server, storage,
and 3rd party services. Azure Resource Manager (ARM) enables you to work with the resources in your application 
as a group, referred to as an Azure Resource Group. You can deploy, update, monitor or delete all of the 
resources for your application in a single, coordinated operation. You use a template for deployment and that 
template can work for different environments such as testing, staging and production. You can clarify billing 
for your organization by viewing the rolled-up costs for the entire group. For more information, see [Azure 
Resource Manager Overview](../resource-group-overview.md). 

A Data Lake Analytics service can include the following components:

* Azure Data Lake Analytics account
* Required default Azure Data Lake Store account
* Additional Azure Data Lake Store accounts
* Additional Azure Storage accounts

You can create all these components under one ARM group to make them easier to manage.

![Azure Data Lake Analytics account and storage](./media/data-lake-analytics-manage-use-portal/data-lake-analytics-arm-structure.png)

A Data Lake Analytics account and the dependent storage accounts must be placed in the same Azure data center.
The ARM group however can be located in a different data center.
