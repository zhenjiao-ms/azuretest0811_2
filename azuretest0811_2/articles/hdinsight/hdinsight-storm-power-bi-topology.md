# Use Power BI to visualize data from an Apache Storm topology
Power BI allows you to visually display data as reports. Using the Visual Studio templates for Storm on HDInsight, you can easily use store data from a topology running on an Apache Storm on HDInsight cluster into SQL Azure, and then visualize the data using Power BI.

In this document, you will learn how to use Power BI to create a report from data generated by an Apache Storm topology and stored in Azure SQL Database.

## Prerequisites
* An Azure subscription. See [Get Azure free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/videos/get-azure-free-trial-for-testing-hadoop-in-hdinsight/).
* An Azure Active Directory user with [Power BI](https://powerbi.com) access
* Visual Studio (one of the following versions)
  
  * Visual Studio 2012 with [update 4](http://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=39305)
  * Visual Studio 2013 with [update 4](http://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=44921) or [Visual Studio 2013 Community](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=517284&clcid=0x409)
  * [Visual Studio 2015](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs.aspx)
* The HDInsight Tools for Visual Studio: See [Get started using the HDInsight Tools for Visual Studio](hdinsight-hadoop-visual-studio-tools-get-started.md) for information on installation information.

## How it works
This example contains a C# Storm topology that randomly generates Internet Information Services (IIS) log data. This data is then written to a SQL Database, and from there it is used to generate reports in Power BI.

The following is a list of the files that implement the main functionality of this example.

* **SqlAzureBolt.cs**: Writes information produced in the Storm topology to SQL Database.
* **IISLogsTable.sql**: The Transact-SQL statements used to generate the database that the data is stored in.

> [!WARNING]
> You must create the table in SQL Database before starting the topology on your HDInsight cluster.
> 
> 

## Download the example
Download the [HDInsight C# Storm Power BI example](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/hdinsight-dotnet-storm-powerbi). To download it, either fork/clone it using [git](http://git-scm.com/), or use the **Download** link to download a .zip of the archive.

## Create a database
1. Use the steps in the [SQL Database tutorial](../sql-database/sql-database-get-started.md) document to create a new SQL Database.
2. Connect to the database by following the steps in the [Connect to a SQL Database with Visual Studio](../sql-database/sql-database-connect-query.md) document to connect to the database.
3. Right click on the database in Object Explorer and create a **New Query**. Paste the contents of the **IISLogsTable.sql** file included in the downloaded project into the query window, and then use Ctrl + Shift + E to execute the query. You should receive a message that the command(s) completed successfully.
   
    Once this completes, there will be a new table named **IISLOGS** in the database.

## Configure the sample
1. From the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select your SQL database. From the **Essentials** section of the SQL database blade, select **Show database connection strings**. From the list that appears, copy the **ADO.NET (SQL authentication)** information.
2. Open the sample in Visual Studio. From **Solution Explorer**, open the **App.config** file, and then find the following entry:
   
        <add key="SqlAzureConnectionString" value="##TOBEFILLED##" />
   
    Replace the **##TOBEFILLED##** value with the database connection string copied in the previous step. Replace **{your\_username}** and **{your\_password}** with the username and password for the database.
3. Save and close the files.

## Deploy the sample
1. From **Solution Explorer**, right-click the **StormToSQL** project and select **Submit to Storm on HDInsight**. Select the HDInsight cluster from the **Storm Cluster** dropdown dialog.
   
   > [!NOTE]
   > It may take a few seconds for the **Storm Cluster** dropdown to populate with server names.
   > 
   > If prompted, enter the login credentials for your Azure subscription. If you have more than one subscription, log in to the one that contains your Storm on HDInsight cluster.
   > 
2. When the topology has been successfully submitted, the Storm Topologies for the cluster should appear. Select the SqlAzureWriterTopology entry from the list to view information about the running topology.
   
    ![The topologies, with the topology selected](./media/hdinsight-storm-power-bi-topology/topologyview.png)
   
    You can use this view to see information on the topology, or double-click on entries (such as the SqlAzureBolt) to see information specific to a component in the topology.
3. After the topology has ran for a few minutes, return to the SQL query window you used to create the database. Replace the existing statements with the following.
   
        select * from iislogs;
   
    Use Ctrl + Shift + E to execute the query, and you should receive results similar to the following.
   
        1    2016-05-27 17:57:14.797    255.255.255.255    /bar    GET    200
        2    2016-05-27 17:57:14.843    127.0.0.1    /spam/eggs    POST    500
        3    2016-05-27 17:57:14.850    123.123.123.123    /eggs    DELETE    200
        4    2016-05-27 17:57:14.853    127.0.0.1    /foo    POST    404
        5    2016-05-27 17:57:14.853    10.9.8.7    /bar    GET    200
        6    2016-05-27 17:57:14.857    192.168.1.1    /spam    DELETE    200
   
    This is data that has been written from the Storm topology.

## Create a report
1. Connect to the [Azure SQL Database connector](https://app.powerbi.com/getdata/bigdata/azure-sql-database-with-live-connect) for Power BI.
2. Within **Databases**, select **Get**.
3. Select **Azure SQL Database**, and then select **Connect**.
4. Enter the information to connect to your Azure SQL Database. You can find this by visiting the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and selecting your SQL database.
   
   > [!NOTE]
   > You can also set the refresh interval and custom filters by using __Enable Advanced Options__ from the connect dialog.
   > 
5. After you've connected, you will see a new dataset with the same name as the database you connected to. Select the dataset to begin designing a report.
6. From **Fields**, expand the **IISLOGS** entry. Select the checkbox for **URISTEM**. This will create a new report that lists the URI stems (/foo, /bar, etc.) logged in the database.
   
    ![Creating a report](./media/hdinsight-storm-power-bi-topology/createreport.png)
7. Next, drag **METHOD** to the report. The report will update to list the stems and the corresponding HTTP method used for the HTTP request.
   
    ![adding the method data](./media/hdinsight-storm-power-bi-topology/uristemandmethod.png)
8. From the **Visualizations** column, select the **Fields** icon, and then select the down arrow next to **METHOD** in the **Values** section. From the list that appears, select **Count**. This will change the report to list a count of how many times a specific URI has been accessed.
   
    ![Changing to a count of methods](./media/hdinsight-storm-power-bi-topology/count.png)
9. Next, select the **Stacked column chart** to change how the information is displayed.
   
    ![Changing to a stacked chart](./media/hdinsight-storm-power-bi-topology/stackedcolumn.png)
10. Once you have the report how you want it, use the **Save** entry on the menu to enter a name and save the report.

## Stop the topology
The topology will continue to run until you stop it or delete the Storm on HDInsight cluster. Perform the following steps to stop the topology.

1. In Visual Studio, return to the topology viewer and select the topology.
2. Select the **Kill** button to stop the topology.
