# Install Giraph on HDInsight Hadoop clusters, and use Giraph to process large-scale graphs
Learn how to customize Windows based HDInsight cluster with Giraph using Script Action, and how to use Giraph to process large-scale graphs. For information on using Giraph with a Linux-based cluster, see [Install Giraph on HDInsight Hadoop clusters (Linux)](hdinsight-hadoop-giraph-install-linux.md).

You can install Giraph on any type of cluster (Hadoop, Storm, HBase, Spark) on Azure HDInsight by using *Script Action*. A sample script to install Giraph on an HDInsight cluster is available from a read-only Azure storage blob at [https://hdiconfigactions.blob.core.windows.net/giraphconfigactionv01/giraph-installer-v01.ps1](https://hdiconfigactions.blob.core.windows.net/giraphconfigactionv01/giraph-installer-v01.ps1). The sample script works only with HDInsight cluster version 3.1. For more information on HDInsight cluster versions, see [HDInsight cluster versions](hdinsight-component-versioning.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The steps in this document use the Azure Classic Portal. Microsoft does not recommend using the classic portal when creating new services. For an explanation of the advantages of the Azure Portal, see [Microsoft Azure Portal](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/azure-portal/).
> 
> This document also includes information on using Azure PowerShell. The snippets provided are based on commands that use Azure Service Management (ASM) to work with HDInsight and are **deprecated**. These commands will be removed by January 1, 2017.
> 
> For a version of this document that uses the Azure portal, along with PowerShell snippets that use Azure Resource Manager (ARM), see [Install Giraph on HDInsight clusters](hdinsight-hadoop-giraph-install.md).

## What is Giraph?
<a href="http://giraph.apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache Giraph</a> allows you to perform graph processing by using Hadoop, and can be used with Azure HDInsight. Graphs model relationships between objects, such as the connections between routers on a large network like the Internet, or relationships between people on social networks (sometimes referred to as a social graph). Graph processing allows you to reason about the relationships between objects in a graph, such as:

* Identifying potential friends based on your current relationships.
* Identifying the shortest route between two computers in a network.
* Calculating the page rank of webpages.

## Install Giraph using portal
1. Start creating a cluster by using the **CUSTOM CREATE** option, as described at [Create Hadoop clusters in HDInsight using custom options](hdinsight-provision-clusters.md#portal). 
2. On the **Script Actions** page of the wizard, click **add script action** to provide details about the script action, as shown below:
   
    ![Use Script Action to customize a cluster](./media/hdinsight-hadoop-giraph-install-v1/hdi-script-action-giraph.png "Use Script Action to customize a cluster")
   
    <table border='1'>
        <tr><th>Property</th><th>Value</th></tr>
        <tr><td>Name</td>
            <td>Specify a name for the script action. For example, <b>Install Giraph</b>.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Script URI</td>
            <td>Specify the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) to the script that is invoked to customize the cluster. For example, <i>https://hdiconfigactions.blob.core.windows.net/giraphconfigactionv01/giraph-installer-v01.ps1</i></td></tr>
        <tr><td>Node Type</td>
            <td>Specify the nodes on which the customization script is run. You can choose <b>All nodes</b>, <b>Head nodes only</b>, or <b>Worker nodes only</b>.
        <tr><td>Parameters</td>
            <td>Specify the parameters, if required by the script. The script to install Giraph does not require any parameters, so you can leave this blank.</td></tr>
    </table>    
   
    You can add more than one script action to install multiple components on the cluster. After you have added the scripts, click the checkmark to start creating the cluster.

You can also use the script to install Giraph on HDInsight by using Azure PowerShell or the HDInsight .NET SDK. Instructions for these procedures are provided later in this topic.

## Use Giraph
We use the SimpleShortestPathsComputation example to demonstrate the basic <a href = "http://people.apache.org/~edwardyoon/documents/pregel.pdf">Pregel</a> implementation for finding the shortest path between objects in a graph. Use the following steps to upload the sample data and the sample jar, run a job by using the SimpleShortestPathsComputation example, and then view the results.

1. Upload a sample data file to Azure Blob storage. On your local workstation, create a new file named **tiny_graph.txt**. It should contain the following lines:
   
        [0,0,[[1,1],[3,3]]]
        [1,0,[[0,1],[2,2],[3,1]]]
        [2,0,[[1,2],[4,4]]]
        [3,0,[[0,3],[1,1],[4,4]]]
        [4,0,[[3,4],[2,4]]]
   
    Upload the tiny_graph.txt file to the primary storage for your HDInsight cluster. For instructions on how to upload data, see [Upload data for Hadoop jobs in HDInsight](hdinsight-upload-data.md).
   
    This data describes a relationship between objects in a directed graph, by using the format [source\_id, source\_value,[[dest\_id], [edge\_value],...]]. Each line represents a relationship between a **source\_id** object and one or more **dest\_id** objects. The **edge\_value** (or weight) can be thought of as the strength or distance of the connection between **source_id** and **dest\_id**.
   
    Drawn out, and using the value (or weight) as the distance between objects, the above data might look like this:
   
    ![tiny_graph.txt drawn as circles with lines of varying distance between](./media/hdinsight-hadoop-giraph-install-v1/giraph-graph.png)
2. Run the SimpleShortestPathsComputation example. Use the following Azure PowerShell cmdlets to run the example by using the tiny_graph.txt file as input. This requires that you have installed and configured [Azure PowerShell](../powershell-install-configure.md).
   
        $clusterName = "clustername"
        # Giraph examples jar
        $jarFile = "wasbs:///example/jars/giraph-examples.jar"
        # Arguments for this job
        $jobArguments = "org.apache.giraph.examples.SimpleShortestPathsComputation",
                        "-ca", "mapred.job.tracker=headnodehost:9010",
                        "-vif", "org.apache.giraph.io.formats.JsonLongDoubleFloatDoubleVertexInputFormat",
                        "-vip", "wasbs:///example/data/tiny_graph.txt",
                        "-vof", "org.apache.giraph.io.formats.IdWithValueTextOutputFormat",
                        "-op",  "wasbs:///example/output/shortestpaths",
                        "-w", "2"
        # Create the definition
        $jobDefinition = New-AzureHDInsightMapReduceJobDefinition
          -JarFile $jarFile
          -ClassName "org.apache.giraph.GiraphRunner"
          -Arguments $jobArguments
   
        # Run the job, write output to the Azure PowerShell window
        $job = Start-AzureHDInsightJob -Cluster $clusterName -JobDefinition $jobDefinition
        Write-Host "Wait for the job to complete ..." -ForegroundColor Green
        Wait-AzureHDInsightJob -Job $job
        Write-Host "STDERR"
        Get-AzureHDInsightJobOutput -Cluster $clusterName -JobId $job.JobId -StandardError
        Write-Host "Display the standard output ..." -ForegroundColor Green
        Get-AzureHDInsightJobOutput -Cluster $clusterName -JobId $job.JobId -StandardOutput
   
    In the above example, replace **clustername** with the name of your HDInsight cluster that has Giraph installed.
3. View the results. Once the job has finished, the results will be stored in two output files in the **wasbs:///example/out/shotestpaths** folder. The files are called **part-m-00001** and **part-m-00002**. Perform the following steps to download and view the output:
   
        $subscriptionName = "<SubscriptionName>"       # Azure subscription name
        $storageAccountName = "<StorageAccountName>"   # Azure Storage account name
        $containerName = "<ContainerName>"             # Blob storage container name
   
        # Select the current subscription
        Select-AzureSubscription $subscriptionName
   
        # Create the Storage account context object
        $storageAccountKey = Get-AzureStorageKey $storageAccountName | %{ $_.Primary }
        $storageContext = New-AzureStorageContext -StorageAccountName $storageAccountName -StorageAccountKey $storageAccountKey
   
        # Download the job output to the workstation
        Get-AzureStorageBlobContent -Container $containerName -Blob example/output/shortestpaths/part-m-00001 -Context $storageContext -Force
        Get-AzureStorageBlobContent -Container $containerName -Blob example/output/shortestpaths/part-m-00002 -Context $storageContext -Force
   
    This will create the **example/output/shortestpaths** directory structure in the current directory on your workstation, and download the two output files to that location.
   
    Use the **Cat** cmdlet to display the contents of the files: 
   
        Cat example/output/shortestpaths/part*
   
    The output should appear similar to the following:

        0    1.0
        4    5.0
        2    2.0
        1    0.0
        3    1.0

    The SimpleShortestPathComputation example is hard coded to start with object ID 1 and find the shortest path to other objects. So the output should be read as `destination_id distance`, where distance is the value (or weight) of the edges traveled between object ID 1 and the target ID.

    Visualizing this, you can verify the results by traveling the shortest paths between ID 1 and all other objects. Note that the shortest path between ID 1 and ID 4 is 5. This is the total distance between <span style="color:orange">ID 1 and 3</span>, and then <span style="color:red">ID 3 and 4</span>.
