# Use Sqoop with Hadoop in HDInsight (SSH)
[!INCLUDE [sqoop-selector](../../includes/hdinsight-selector-use-sqoop.md)]

Learn how to use Sqoop to import and export between a Linux-based HDInsight cluster and Azure SQL Database or SQL Server database.

> [!NOTE]
> The steps in this article use SSH to connect to a Linux-based HDInsight cluster. Windows clients can also use Azure PowerShell and HDInsight .NET SDK to work with Sqoop on Linux-based clusters. Use the tab selector to open those articles.
> 
> 

## Prerequisites
Before you begin this tutorial, you must have the following:

* **A Hadoop cluster in HDInsight** and an **Azure SQL Database**: The steps in this document are based on the cluster and database created using the [Create cluster and SQL database](hdinsight-use-sqoop.md#create-cluster-and-sql-database) document. If you already have an HDInsight cluster and SQL Database, you can substitute those for the values used in this document.
* **Workstation**: A computer with an SSH client.

## Install FreeTDS
1. Use SSH to connect to the Linux-based HDInsight cluster. The address to use when connecting is `CLUSTERNAME-ssh.azurehdinsight.net` and the port is `22`.
   
    For more information on using SSH to connect to HDInsight, see the following documents:
   
   * **Linux, Unix or OS X clients**: See [Connect to a Linux-based HDInsight cluster from Linux, OS X or Unix](hdinsight-hadoop-linux-use-ssh-unix.md#connect-to-a-linux-based-hdinsight-cluster)
   * **Windows clients**: See [Connect to a Linux-based HDInsight cluster from Windows](hdinsight-hadoop-linux-use-ssh-windows.md#connect-to-a-linux-based-hdinsight-cluster)
2. Use the following command to install FreeTDS:
   
        sudo apt-get --assume-yes install freetds-dev freetds-bin
   
    FreeTDS will be used in several steps to connect to SQL Database.

## Create the table in SQL Database
> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are using an HDInsight cluster and SQL Database created using the steps in [Create cluster and SQL database](hdinsight-use-sqoop.md), ignore the steps in this section as the database and table were created as part of the steps in that document.
> 
> 

1. From the SSH connection to HDInsight, use the following command to connect to the SQL Database server and crete the table that will be used in the remainder of these steps:
   
        TDSVER=8.0 tsql -H <serverName>.database.windows.net -U <adminLogin> -P <adminPassword> -p 1433 -D sqooptest
   
    You will receive output similar to the following:
   
        locale is "en_US.UTF-8"
        locale charset is "UTF-8"
        using default charset "UTF-8"
        Default database being set to sqooptest
        1>
2. At the `1>` prompt, enter the following lines:
   
        CREATE TABLE [dbo].[mobiledata](
        [clientid] [nvarchar](50),
        [querytime] [nvarchar](50),
        [market] [nvarchar](50),
        [deviceplatform] [nvarchar](50),
        [devicemake] [nvarchar](50),
        [devicemodel] [nvarchar](50),
        [state] [nvarchar](50),
        [country] [nvarchar](50),
        [querydwelltime] [float],
        [sessionid] [bigint],
        [sessionpagevieworder] [bigint])
        GO
        CREATE CLUSTERED INDEX mobiledata_clustered_index on mobiledata(clientid)
        GO
   
    When the `GO` statement is entered, the previous statements will be evaluated. First, the **mobiledata** table is created, then a clustered index is added to it (required by SQL Database.)
   
    Use the following to verify that the table has been created:
   
        SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables
        GO
   
    You should see output similar to the following:
   
        TABLE_CATALOG   TABLE_SCHEMA    TABLE_NAME      TABLE_TYPE
        sqooptest       dbo     mobiledata      BASE TABLE
3. Enter `exit` at the `1>` prompt to exit the tsql utility.

## Sqoop export
1. From the SSH connection to HDInsight, se the following command to verify that Sqoop can see your SQL Database:
   
        sqoop list-databases --connect jdbc:sqlserver://<serverName>.database.windows.net:1433 --username <adminLogin> --password <adminPassword>
   
    This should return a list of databases, including the **sqooptest** database that you created earlier.
2. Use the following command to export data from **hivesampletable** to the **mobiledata** table:
   
        sqoop export --connect 'jdbc:sqlserver://<serverName>.database.windows.net:1433;database=sqooptest' --username <adminLogin> --password <adminPassword> --table 'mobiledata' --export-dir 'wasbs:///hive/warehouse/hivesampletable' --fields-terminated-by '\t' -m 1
   
    This instructs Sqoop to connect to SQL Database, to the **sqooptest** database, and export data from the **wasbs:///hive/warehouse/hivesampletable** (physical files for the *hivesampletable*,) to the **mobiledata** table.
3. After the command completes, use the following to connect to the database using TSQL:
   
        TDSVER=8.0 tsql -H <serverName>.database.windows.net -U <adminLogin> -P <adminPassword> -p 1433 -D sqooptest
   
    Once connected, use the following statements to verify that the data was exported to the **mobiledata** table:
   
        SELECT * FROM mobiledata
        GO
   
    You should see a listing of data in the table. Type `exit` to exit the tsql utility.

## Sqoop import
1. Use the following to import data from the **mobiledata** table in SQL Database, to the **wasbs:///tutorials/usesqoop/importeddata** directory on HDInsight:
   
        sqoop import --connect 'jdbc:sqlserver://<serverName>.database.windows.net:1433;database=sqooptest' --username <adminLogin> --password <adminPassword> --table 'mobiledata' --target-dir 'wasbs:///tutorials/usesqoop/importeddata' --fields-terminated-by '\t' --lines-terminated-by '\n' -m 1
   
    The imported data will have fields that are separated by a tab character, and the lines will be terminated by a new-line character.
2. Once the import has completed, use the following command to list out the data in the new directory:
   
        hadoop fs -text wasbs:///tutorials/usesqoop/importeddata/part-m-00000

## Using SQL Server
You can also use Sqoop to import and export data from SQL Server, either in your data center or on a Virtual Machine hosted in Azure. The differences between using SQL Database and SQL Server are:

* Both HDInsight and the SQL Server must be on the same Azure Virtual Network
  
  > [!NOTE]
  > HDInsight supports only location-based virtual networks, and it does not currently work with affinity group-based virtual networks.
  > 
  > 
  
    When you are using SQL Server in your datacenter, you must configure the virtual network as *site-to-site* or *point-to-site*.
  
  > [!NOTE]
  > For **point-to-site** virtual networks, SQL Server must be running the VPN client configuration application, which is available from the **Dashboard** of your Azure virtual network configuration.
  > 
  > 
  
    For more information on creating and configuring a virtual network, see [Virtual Network Configuration Tasks](../services/virtual-machines.md).
* SQL Server must be configured to allow SQL authentication. For more information, see [Choose an Authentication Mode](https://msdn.microsoft.com/ms144284.aspx)
* You may have to configure SQL Server to accept remote connections. See [How to troubleshoot connecting to the SQL Server database engine](http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/2102.how-to-troubleshoot-connecting-to-the-sql-server-database-engine.aspx) for more information
* You must create the **sqooptest** database in SQL Server using a utility such as **SQL Server Management Studio** or **tsql** - the steps for using the Azure CLI only work for Azure SQL Database
  
    The TSQL statements to create the **mobiledata** table are similar those used for SQL Database, with the exception of creating a clusterd index - this is not required for SQL Server:
  
        CREATE TABLE [dbo].[mobiledata](
        [clientid] [nvarchar](50),
        [querytime] [nvarchar](50),
        [market] [nvarchar](50),
        [deviceplatform] [nvarchar](50),
        [devicemake] [nvarchar](50),
        [devicemodel] [nvarchar](50),
        [state] [nvarchar](50),
        [country] [nvarchar](50),
        [querydwelltime] [float],
        [sessionid] [bigint],
        [sessionpagevieworder] [bigint])
* When connecting to the SQL Server from HDInsight, you may have to use the IP address of the SQL Server unless you have configured a Domain Name System (DNS) to resolve names on the Azure Virtual Network. For example:
  
        sqoop import --connect 'jdbc:sqlserver://10.0.1.1:1433;database=sqooptest' --username <adminLogin> --password <adminPassword> --table 'mobiledata' --target-dir 'wasbs:///tutorials/usesqoop/importeddata' --fields-terminated-by '\t' --lines-terminated-by '\n' -m 1

## Limitations
* Bulk export - With Linux-based HDInsight, the Sqoop connector used to export data to Microsoft SQL Server or Azure SQL Database does not currently support bulk inserts.
* Batching - With Linux-based HDInsight, When using the `-batch` switch when performing inserts, Sqoop will perform multiple inserts instead of batching the insert operations.
