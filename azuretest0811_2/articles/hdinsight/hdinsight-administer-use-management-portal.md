# Manage Hadoop clusters in HDInsight by using the Azure Portal
[!INCLUDE [selector](../../includes/hdinsight-portal-management-selector.md)]

Using the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com), you can create Hadoop clusters in Azure HDInsight, change Hadoop user password, and enable Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) so you can access the Hadoop command console on the cluster.

The information in this article only applies to Window-based HDInsight clusters. For information on managing Linux-based clusters, click the tab selector above.

Click the tab selector for information on creating Hadoop clusters in HDInsight using other tools. 

**Prerequisites**

Before you begin this article, you must have the following:

* **An Azure subscription**. See [Get Azure free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/videos/get-azure-free-trial-for-testing-hadoop-in-hdinsight/).
* **Azure Storage account** - An HDInsight cluster uses an Azure Blob storage container as the default file system. For more information about how Azure Blob storage provides a seamless experience with HDInsight clusters, see [Use Azure Blob Storage with HDInsight](hdinsight-hadoop-use-blob-storage.md). For details on creating an Azure Storage account, see [How to Create a Storage Account](../storage/storage-create-storage-account.md).

## Open the Portal
1. Sign in to [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com).
2. After you open the portal, you can:
   
   * Click **New** from the left menu to create a new cluster:
     
       ![new HDInsight cluster buttom](./media/hdinsight-administer-use-management-portal/azure-portal-new-button.png)
   * Click **HDInsight Clusters** from the left menu.
     
       ![Azure portal HDInsight cluster buttom](./media/hdinsight-administer-use-management-portal/azure-portal-hdinsight-button.png)
     
     If **HDInsight** doesn't appear in the left menu, click **Browse**. 
     
     ![Azure portal Browse cluster buttom](./media/hdinsight-administer-use-management-portal/azure-portal-browse-button.png)

## Create clusters
For the creation instructions using the Portal, see [Create HDInsight clusters](hdinsight-provision-clusters.md#create-using-the-preview-portal).

HDInsight works with a wide range of Hadoop components. For the list of the components that have been verified and supported, 
see [What version of Hadoop is in Azure HDInsight](hdinsight-component-versioning.md). You can customize HDInsight by using one of the following options:

* Use Script Action to run custom scripts that can customize a cluster to either change cluster configuration or install custom components such as Giraph or Solr. For more information, see [Customize HDInsight cluster using Script Action](hdinsight-hadoop-customize-cluster.md).
* Use the cluster customization parameters in the HDInsight .NET SDK or Azure PowerShell during cluster creation. These configuration changes are then preserved through the lifetime of the cluster and are not affected by cluster node reimages that Azure platform periodically performs for maintenance. For more information on using the cluster customization parameters, see [Create HDInsight clusters](hdinsight-provision-clusters.md).
* Some native Java components, like Mahout and Cascading, can be run on the cluster as JAR files. These JAR files can be distributed to Azure Blob storage, and submitted to HDInsight clusters through Hadoop job submission mechanisms. For more information, see [Submit Hadoop jobs programmatically](hdinsight-submit-hadoop-jobs-programmatically.md).
  
  > [!NOTE]
  > If you have issues deploying JAR files to HDInsight clusters or calling JAR files on HDInsight clusters, contact [Microsoft Support](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/options/).
  > 
  > Cascading is not supported by HDInsight, and is not eligible for Microsoft Support. For lists of supported components, see [What's new in the cluster versions provided by HDInsight?](hdinsight-component-versioning.md).
  > 
  > 

Installation of custom software on the cluster by using Remote Desktop Connection is not supported. You should avoid storing any files on the drives of the head node, as they will be lost if you need to re-create the clusters. We recommend storing files on Azure Blob storage. Blob storage is persistent.

1. Sign in to the [Portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Click **Browse All** from the left menu, click **HDInsight Clusters**, click your cluster name.
3. Click **Delete** from the top menu, and then follow the instructions.

See also [Pause/shut down clusters](#pauseshut-down-clusters).

## Scale clusters
The cluster scaling feature allows you to change the number of worker nodes used by a cluster that is running in Azure HDInsight without having to re-create the cluster.

> [!NOTE]
> Only clusters with HDInsight version 3.1.3 or higher are supported. If you are unsure of the version of your cluster, you can check the Properties page.  See [List and show clusters](hdinsight-adminster-use-management-portal.md#list-and-show-clusters).
> 
> 

The impact of changing the number of data nodes for each type of cluster supported by HDInsight:

* Hadoop
  
    You can seamlessly increase the number of worker nodes in a Hadoop cluster that is running without impacting any pending or running jobs. New jobs can also be submitted while the operation is in progress. Failures in a scaling operation are gracefully handled so that the cluster is always left in a functional state.
  
    When a Hadoop cluster is scaled down by reducing the number of data nodes, some of the services in the cluster are restarted. This causes all running and pending jobs to fail at the completion of the scaling operation. You can, however, resubmit the jobs once the operation is complete.
* HBase
  
    You can seamlessly add or remove nodes to your HBase cluster while it is running. Regional Servers are automatically balanced within a few minutes of completing the scaling operation. However, you can also manually balance the regional servers by logging into the headnode of cluster and running the following commands from a command prompt window:
  
        >pushd %HBASE_HOME%\bin
        >hbase shell
        >balancer
  
    For more information on using the HBase shell, see []
* Storm
  
    You can seamlessly add or remove data nodes to your Storm cluster while it is running. But after a successful completion of the scaling operation, you will need to rebalance the topology.
  
    Rebalancing can be accomplished in two ways:
  
  * Storm web UI
  * Command-line interface (CLI) tool
    
    Please refer to the [Apache Storm documentation](http://storm.apache.org/documentation/Understanding-the-parallelism-of-a-Storm-topology.html) for more details.
    
    The Storm web UI is available on the HDInsight cluster:
    
    ![hdinsight storm scale rebalance](./media/hdinsight-administer-use-management-portal/hdinsight.portal.scale.cluster.storm.rebalance.png)
    
    Here is an example how to use the CLI command to rebalance the Storm topology:
    
    ## Reconfigure the topology "mytopology" to use 5 worker processes,
    ## the spout "blue-spout" to use 3 executors, and
    ## the bolt "yellow-bolt" to use 10 executors
      $ storm rebalance mytopology -n 5 -e blue-spout=3 -e yellow-bolt=10

**To scale clusters**

1. Sign in to the [Portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Click **Browse All** from the left menu, click **HDInsight Clusters**, click your cluster name.
3. Click **Settings** from the top menu, and then click **Scale Cluster**.
4. Enter **Number of Worker nodes**. The limit on the number of cluster node varies among Azure subscriptions. You can contact billing support to increase the limit.  The cost information will reflect the changes you have made to the number of nodes.

## Pause/shut down clusters
Most of Hadoop jobs are batch jobs that are only ran occasionally. For most Hadoop clusters, there are large periods of time that the cluster is not being used for processing. With HDInsight, your data is stored in Azure Storage, so you can safely delete a cluster when it is not in use.
You are also charged for an HDInsight cluster, even when it is not in use. Since the charges for the cluster are many times more than the charges for storage, it makes economic sense to delete clusters when they are not in use.

There are many ways you can program the process:

* User Azure Data Factory. See [Azure HDInsight Linked Service](../data-factory/data-factory-compute-linked-services.md) and [Transform and analyze using Azure Data Factory](../data-factory/data-factory-data-transformation-activities.md) for on-demand and self-defined HDInsight linked services.
* Use Azure PowerShell.  See [Analyze flight delay data](hdinsight-analyze-flight-delay-data.md).
* Use Azure CLI. See [Manage HDInsight clusters using Azure CLI](hdinsight-administer-use-command-line.md).
* Use HDInsight .NET SDK. See [Submit Hadoop jobs](hdinsight-submit-hadoop-jobs-programmatically.md).

For the pricing information, see [HDInsight pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/hdinsight/). To delete a cluster from the Portal, see [Delete clusters](#delete-clusters)

## Change cluster username
An HDInsight cluster can have two user accounts. The HDInsight cluster user account is created during the creation process. You can also create an RDP user account for accessing the cluster via RDP. See [Enable remote desktop](#connect-to-hdinsight-clusters-by-using-rdp).

**To change the HDInsight cluster user name and password**

1. Sign in to the [Portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Click **Browse All** from the left menu, click **HDInsight Clusters**, click your cluster name.
3. Click **Settings** from the top menu, and then click **Cluster Login**.
4. If **Cluster login** has been enabled, you must click **Disable**, and then click **Enable** before you can change the username and password..
5. Change the **Cluster Login Name** and/or the **Cluster Login Password**, and then click **Save**.
   
    ![hdinsight change cluster user username password http user](./media/hdinsight-administer-use-management-portal/hdinsight.portal.change.username.password.png)

## Grant/revoke access
HDInsight clusters have the following HTTP web services (all of these services have RESTful endpoints):

* ODBC
* JDBC
* Ambari
* Oozie
* Templeton

By default, these services are granted for access. You can revoke/grant the access from the Azure Portal.

> [!NOTE]
> By granting/revoking the access, you will reset the cluster user name and password.
> 
> 

**To grant/revoke HTTP web services access**

1. Sign in to the [Portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Click **Browse All** from the left menu, click **HDInsight Clusters**, click your cluster name.
3. Click **Settings** from the top menu, and then click **Cluster Login**.
4. If **Cluster login** has been enabled, you must click **Disable**, and then click **Enable** before you can change the username and password..
5. For **Cluster Login Username** and **Cluster Login Password**, enter the new user name and password (respectively) for the cluster.
6. Click **SAVE**.
   
    ![hdinsight grand remove http web service access](./media/hdinsight-administer-use-management-portal/hdinsight.portal.change.username.password.png)

## Find the default storage account
Each HDInsight cluster has a default storage account. The default storage account and its keys for a cluster apears under **Settings**/**Properties**/**Azure Storage Keys**. See [List and show clusters](#list-and-show-clusters).

## Find the resource group
In the ARM mode, each HDInsight cluster is created with an Azure resource group. The Azure resource group that a cluster belongs to appears in:

* The cluster list has a **Resource Group** column.
* Cluster **Essential** tile.  

See [List and show clusters](#list-and-show-clusters).

## Open HDInsight Query console
The HDInsight Query console includes the following features:

* **Getting started gallery**: To use the gallery , see [Learn Hadoop by using the Azure HDInsight Getting Started Gallery](hdinsight-learn-hadoop-use-sample-gallery.md).
* **Hive Editor**: A GUI web interface for submitting Hive jobs.  See [Run Hive queries using the Query Console](hdinsight-hadoop-use-hive-query-console.md).
  
    ![hdinsight portal hive editor](./media/hdinsight-administer-use-management-portal/hdinsight-hive-editor.png)

## Open Yarn UI
To use Yarn user interface, click **Yarn UI** in the HDInsight Query console. See [Open HDInsight Query console](#open-hdinsight-query-console).

## Connect to clusters using RDP
The credentials for the cluster that you provided at its creation give access to the services on the cluster, but not to the cluster itself through Remote Desktop. You can turn on Remote Desktop access when you provision a cluster or after a cluster is provisioned. For the instructions about enabling Remote Desktop at creation, see [Create HDInsight cluster](hdinsight-provision-clusters.md).

**To enable Remote Desktop**

1. Sign in to the [Portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Click **Browse All** from the left menu, click **HDInsight Clusters**, click your cluster name.
3. Click **Settings** from the top menu, and then click **Remote Desktop**.
4. Enter **Expires On**, **Remote Desktop Username** and **Remote Desktop Password**, and then click **Enable**.
   
    ![hdinsight enable disable configure remote desktop](./media/hdinsight-administer-use-management-portal/hdinsight.portal.remote.desktop.png)
   
    The default values for Expires On is a week.
   
   > [!NOTE]
   > You can also use the HDInsight .NET SDK to enable Remote Desktop on a cluster. Use the **EnableRdp** method on the HDInsight client object in the following manner: **client.EnableRdp(clustername, location, "rdpuser", "rdppassword", DateTime.Now.AddDays(6))**. Similarly, to disable Remote Desktop on the cluster, you can use **client.DisableRdp(clustername, location)**. For more information on these methods, see [HDInsight .NET SDK Reference](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=529017). This is applicable only for HDInsight clusters running on Windows.

**To connect to a cluster by using RDP**

1. Sign in to the [Portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Click **Browse All** from the left menu, click **HDInsight Clusters**, click your cluster name.
3. Click **Settings** from the top menu, and then click **Remote Desktop**.
4. Click **Connect** and follow the instructions. If Connect is disable, you must enable it first. Make sure using the Remote Desktop user username and password.  You can't use the Cluster user credentials.

## Open Hadoop command line
To connect to the cluster by using Remote Desktop and use the Hadoop command line, you must first have enabled Remote Desktop access to the cluster as described in the previous section.

**To open a Hadoop command line**

1. Connect to the cluster using Remote Desktop.
2. From the desktop, double-click **Hadoop Command Line**.
   
    ![HDI.HadoopCommandLine](./media/hdinsight-administer-use-management-portal/hdinsight-hadoop-command-line.png "Hadoop command line")
   
    For more information on Hadoop commands, see [Hadoop commands reference](http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/CommandsManual.html).

In the previous screenshot, the folder name has the Hadoop version number embedded. The version number can changed based on the version of the Hadoop components installed on the cluster. You can use Hadoop environment variables to refer to those folders. For example:

    cd %hadoop_home%
    cd %hive_home%
    cd %hbase_home%
    cd %pig_home%
    cd %sqoop_home%
    cd %hcatalog_home%
