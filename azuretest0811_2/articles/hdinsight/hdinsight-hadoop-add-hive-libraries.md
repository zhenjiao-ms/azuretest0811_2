# Add Hive libraries during HDInsight cluster creation
If you have libraries that you use frequently with Hive on HDInsight, this document contains information on using a Script Action to pre-load the libraries during cluster creation. This makes the libraries globally available in Hive (no need to use [ADD JAR](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+Cli) to load them.)

## How it works
When creating a cluster, you can optionally specify a Script Action that runs a script on the cluster nodes while they are being created. The script in this document accepts a single parameter, which is a WASB location that contains the libraries (stored as jar files,) that will be pre-loaded.

During cluster creation, the script enumerates the files, copies them to the `/usr/lib/customhivelibs/` directory on head and worker nodes, then adds them to the `hive.aux.jars.path` property in the `core-site.xml` file. On Linux-based clusters, it also updates the `hive-env.sh` file with the location of the files.

> [!NOTE]
> Using the script actions in this article makes the libraries available in the following scenarios:
> 
> * **Linux-based HDInsight** - when using the **Hive command-line**, **WebHCat** (Templeton,) and **HiveServer2**.
> * **Windows-based HDInsight** - when using the **Hive command-line** and **WebHCat** (Templeton).
>

## The script
**Script location**

For **Linux-based clusters**: [https://hdiconfigactions.blob.core.windows.net/linuxsetupcustomhivelibsv01/setup-customhivelibs-v01.sh](https://hdiconfigactions.blob.core.windows.net/linuxsetupcustomhivelibsv01/setup-customhivelibs-v01.sh)

For **Windows-based clusters**: [https://hdiconfigactions.blob.core.windows.net/setupcustomhivelibsv01/setup-customhivelibs-v01.ps1](https://hdiconfigactions.blob.core.windows.net/setupcustomhivelibsv01/setup-customhivelibs-v01.ps1)

**Requirements**

* The scripts must be applied to both the **Head nodes** and **Worker nodes**.
* The jars you wish to install must be stored in Azure Blob Storage in a **single container**. 
* The storage account containing the library of jar files **must** be linked to the HDInsight cluster during creation. This can be accomplished in one of two ways:
  
  * By being in a container on the default storage account for the cluster.
  * By being in a container on an linked storage container. For example, in the portal you can use **Optional Configuration**, **Linked storage accounts** to add additional storage.
* The WASB path to the container must be specified as a parameter to the Script Action. For example, if the jars are stored in a container named **libs** on a storage account named **mystorage**, the parameter would be **wasbs://libs@mystorage.blob.core.windows.net/**.
  
  > [!NOTE]
  > This document assumes that you have already create a storage account, blob container, and uploaded the files to it. 
  > 
  > If you have not created a storage account, you can do this through the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). You can then use a utility such as [Azure Storage Explorer](http://storageexplorer.com/) to create a new container in the account and upload files to it.

## Create a cluster using the script
> [!NOTE]
> The following steps create a new Linux-based HDInsight cluster. To create a new Windows-based cluster, select **Windows** as the cluster OS when creating the cluster, and use the Windows (PowerShell) script instead of the bash script.
> 
> You can also use Azure PowerShell or the HDInsight .NET SDK to create a cluster using this script. For more information on using these methods, see [Customize HDInsight clusters with Script Actions](hdinsight-hadoop-customize-cluster-linux.md).

1. Start provisioning a cluster by using the steps in [Provision HDInsight clusters on Linux](hdinsight-hadoop-provision-linux-clusters.md#portal), but do not complete provisioning.
2. On the **Optional Configuration** blade, select **Script Actions**, and provide the information as shown below:
   
   * **NAME**: Enter a friendly name for the script action.
   * **SCRIPT URI**: https://hdiconfigactions.blob.core.windows.net/linuxsetupcustomhivelibsv01/setup-customhivelibs-v01.sh
   * **HEAD**: Check this option
   * **WORKER**: Check this option.
   * **ZOOKEEPER**: Leave this blank.
   * **PARAMETERS**: Enter the WASB address to the container and storage account that contains the jars. For example, **wasbs://libs@mystorage.blob.core.windows.net/**.
3. At the bottom of the **Script Actions**, use the **Select** button to save the configuration.
4. On the **Optional Configuration** blade, select **Linked Storage Accounts** and select the **Add a storage key** link. Select the storage account that contains the jars, and then use the **select** buttons to save settings and return the **Optional Configuration** blade.
5. Use the **Select** button at the bottom of the **Optional Configuration** blade to save the optional configuration information.
6. Continue provisioning the cluster as described in [Provision HDInsight clusters on Linux](hdinsight-hadoop-provision-linux-clusters.md#portal).

Once cluster creation finishes, you will be able to use the jars added through this script from Hive without having to use the `ADD JAR` statement.
