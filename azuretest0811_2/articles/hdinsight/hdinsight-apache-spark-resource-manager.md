# Manage resources for the Apache Spark cluster on HDInsight Linux
In this article you will learn how to access the interfaces like Ambari UI, YARN UI, and the Spark History Server associated with your Spark cluster. You will also learn about how to tune the cluster configuration for optimal performance.

**Prerequisites:**

You must have the following:

* An Azure subscription. See [Get Azure free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/videos/get-azure-free-trial-for-testing-hadoop-in-hdinsight/).
* An Apache Spark cluster on HDInsight Linux. For instructions, see [Create Apache Spark clusters in Azure HDInsight](hdinsight-apache-spark-jupyter-spark-sql.md).

## How do I launch the Ambari Web UI?
1. From the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/), from the startboard, click the tile for your Spark cluster (if you pinned it to the startboard). You can also navigate to your cluster under **Browse All** > **HDInsight Clusters**. 
2. From the Spark cluster blade, click **Dashboard**. When prompted, enter the admin credentials for the Spark cluster.
   
    ![Launch Ambari](./media/hdinsight-apache-spark-resource-manager/hdispark.cluster.launch.dashboard.png "Start Resource Manager")
3. This should launch the Ambari Web UI, as shown below.
   
    ![Ambari Web UI](./media/hdinsight-apache-spark-resource-manager/ambari-web-ui.png "Ambari Web UI")   

## How do I launch the Spark History Server?
1. From the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/), from the startboard, click the tile for your Spark cluster (if you pinned it to the startboard).
2. From the cluster blade, under **Quick Links**, click **Cluster Dashboard**. In the **Cluster Dashboard** blade, click **Spark History Server**.
   
    ![Spark History Server](./media/hdinsight-apache-spark-resource-manager/launch-history-server.png "Spark History Server")
   
    When prompted, enter the admin credentials for the Spark cluster.

## How do I launch the Yarn UI?
You can use the YARN UI to monitor applications that are currently running on the Spark cluster. 

1. From the cluster blade, click **Cluster Dashboard**, and then click **YARN**.
   
    ![Launch YARN UI](./media/hdinsight-apache-spark-resource-manager/launch-yarn-ui.png)
   
   > [!TIP]
   > Alternatively, you can also launch the YARN UI from the Ambari UI. To launch the Ambari UI, from the cluster blade, click **Cluster Dashboard**, and then click **HDInsight Cluster Dashboard**. From the Ambari UI, click **YARN**, click **Quick Links**, click the active resource manager, and then click **ResourceManager UI**.

## What is the optimum cluster configuration to run Spark applications?
The three key parameters that can be used for Spark configuration depending on application requirements are `spark.executor.instances`, `spark.executor.cores`, and `spark.executor.memory`. An Executor is a process launched for a Spark application. It runs on the worker node and is responsible to carry out the tasks for the application. The default number of executors and the executor sizes for each cluster is calculated based on the number of worker nodes and the worker node size. These are stored in `spark-defaults.conf` on the cluster head nodes. 

The three configuration parameters can be configured at the cluster level (for all applications that run on the cluster) or can be specified for each individual application as well.

### Change the parameters using Ambari UI
1. From the Ambari UI click **Spark**, click **Configs**, and then expand **Custom spark-defaults**.
   
    ![Set parameters using Ambari](./media/hdinsight-apache-spark-resource-manager/set-parameters-using-ambari.png)
2. The default values are good to have 4 Spark applications run concurrently on the cluster. You can changes these values from the user interface, as shown below.
   
    ![Set parameters using Ambari](./media/hdinsight-apache-spark-resource-manager/set-executor-parameters.png)
3. Click **Save** to save the configuration changes. At the top of the page, you will be prompted to restart all the affected services. Click **Restart**.
   
    ![Restart services](./media/hdinsight-apache-spark-resource-manager/restart-services.png)

### Change the parameters for an application running in Jupyter notebook
For applications running in the Jupyter notebook, you can use the `%%configure` magic to make the configuration changes. Ideally, you must make such changes at the beginning of the application, before you run your first code cell. This ensures that the configuration is applied to the Livy session, when it gets created. If you want to change the configuration at a later stage in the application, you must use the `-f` parameter. However, by doing so all progress in the application will be lost.

The snippet below shows how to change the configuration for an application running in Jupyter.

    %%configure 
    {"executorMemory": "3072M", "executorCores": 4, “numExecutors”:10}

Configuration parameters must be passed in as a JSON string and must be on the next line after the magic, as shown in the example column. 

### Change the parameters for an application submitted using spark-submit
Following command is an example of how to change the configuration parameters for a batch application that is submitted using `spark-submit`.

    spark-submit --class <the application class to execute> --executor-memory 3072M --executor-cores 4 –-num-executors 10 <location of application jar file> <application parameters>

### Change the parameters for an application submitted using cURL
Following command is an example of how to change the configuration parameters for a batch application that is submitted using using cURL.

    curl -k -v -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -X POST -d '{"file":"<location of application jar file>", "className":"<the application class to execute>", "args":[<application parameters>], "numExecutors":10, "executorMemory":"2G", "executorCores":5' localhost:8998/batches

### How do I change these parameters on a Spark Thrift Server?
Spark Thrift Server provides JDBC/ODBC access to a Spark cluster and is used to service Spark SQL queries. Tools like Power BI, Tableau etc. use ODBC protocol to communicate with Spark Thrift Server to execute Spark SQL queries as a Spark Application. When a Spark cluster is created, two instances of the Spark Thrift Server are started, one on each head node. Each Spark Thrift Server is visible as a Spark application in the YARN UI. 

Spark Thrift Server uses Spark dynamic executor allocation and hence the `spark.executor.instances` is not used. Instead, Spark Thrift Server uses `spark.dynamicAllocation.minExecutors` and `spark.dynamicAllocation.maxExecutors` to specify the executor count. The configuration parameters `spark.executor.cores` and `spark.executor.memory` is used to modify the executor size. You can change these parameters as shown below.

* Expand the **Advanced spark-thrift-sparkconf** category to update the parameters `spark.dynamicAllocation.minExecutors`, `spark.dynamicAllocation.maxExecutors`, and `spark.executor.memory`.
  
    ![Configure Spark thrift server](./media/hdinsight-apache-spark-resource-manager/spark-thrift-server-1.png)    
* Expand the **Custom spark-thrift-sparkconf** category to update the parameter `spark.executor.cores`.
  
    ![Configure Spark thrift server](./media/hdinsight-apache-spark-resource-manager/spark-thrift-server-2.png)

### How do I change the driver memory of the Spark Thrift Server?
Spark Thrift Server driver memory is configured to 25% of the head node RAM size, provided the total RAM size of the head node is greater than 14GB. You can use the Ambari UI to change the driver memory configuration, as shown below.

* From the Ambari UI click **Spark**, click **Configs**, expand **Advanced spark-env**, and then provide the value for **spark_thrift_cmd_opts**.
  
    ![Configure Spark thrift server RAM](./media/hdinsight-apache-spark-resource-manager/spark-thrift-server-ram.png)

## I do not use BI with Spark cluster. How do I take the resources back?
Since we use Spark dynamic allocation, the only resources that are consumed by thrift server are the resources for the two application masters. To reclaim these resources you must stop the Thrift Server services running on the cluster.

1. From the Ambari UI, from the left pane, click **Spark**.
2. In the next page, click **Spark Thrift Servers**.
   
    ![Restart thrift server](./media/hdinsight-apache-spark-resource-manager/restart-thrift-server-1.png)
3. You should see the two headnodes on which the Spark Thrift Server is running. Click one of the headnodes.
   
    ![Restart thrift server](./media/hdinsight-apache-spark-resource-manager/restart-thrift-server-2.png)
4. The next page lists all the services running on that headnode. From the list click the drop-down button next to Spark Thrift Server, and then click **Stop**.
   
    ![Restart thrift server](./media/hdinsight-apache-spark-resource-manager/restart-thrift-server-3.png)
5. Repeat these steps on the other headnode as well.

## My Jupyter notebooks are not running as expected. How can I restart the service?
1. Launch the Ambari Web UI as shown above. From the left navigation pane, click **Jupyter**, click **Service Actions**, and then click **Restart All**. This will start the Jupyter service on all the headnodes.
   
    ![Restart Jupyter](./media/hdinsight-apache-spark-resource-manager/restart-jupyter.png "Restart Jupyter")
