# Install and use Hue on HDInsight Hadoop clusters
Learn how to install Hue on HDInsight Linux clusters and use tunneling to route the requests to Hue.

## What is Hue?
Hue is a set of Web applications used to interact with a Hadoop cluster. You can use Hue to browse the storage associated with a Hadoop cluster (WASB, in the case of HDInsight clusters), run Hive jobs and Pig scripts, etc. The following components are available with Hue installations on an HDInsight Hadoop cluster.

* Beeswax Hive Editor
* Pig
* Metastore manager
* Oozie
* FileBrowser (which talks to WASB default container)
* Job Browser

> [!WARNING]
> Components provided with the HDInsight cluster are fully supported and Microsoft Support will help to isolate and resolve issues related to these components.
> 
> Custom components receive commercially reasonable support to help you to further troubleshoot the issue. This might result in resolving the issue OR asking you to engage available channels for the open source technologies where deep expertise for that technology is found. For example, there are many community sites that can be used, like: [MSDN forum for HDInsight](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/azure/en-US/home?forum=hdinsight), [http://stackoverflow.com](http://stackoverflow.com). Also Apache projects have project sites on [http://apache.org](http://apache.org), for example: [Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org/).

## Install Hue using Script Actions
The following script action can be used to install Hue on a Linux-based HDInsight cluster.
    https://hdiconfigactions.blob.core.windows.net/linuxhueconfigactionv02/install-hue-uber-v02.sh

This section provides instructions about how to use the script when provisioning the cluster using the Azure Portal. 

> [!NOTE]
> Azure PowerShell, the Azure CLI, the HDInsight .NET SDK, or Azure Resource Manager templates can also be used to apply script actions. You can also apply script actions to already running clusters. For more information, see [Customize HDInsight clusters with Script Actions](hdinsight-hadoop-customize-cluster-linux.md).
> 
> 

1. Start provisioning a cluster by using the steps in [Provision HDInsight clusters on Linux](hdinsight-hadoop-provision-linux-clusters.md#portal), but do not complete provisioning.
   
   > [!NOTE]
   > To install Hue on HDInsight clusters, the recommended headnode size is at least A4 (8 cores, 14 GB memory).
   > 
2. On the **Optional Configuration** blade, select **Script Actions**, and provide the information as shown below:
   
    ![Provide script action parameters for Hue](./media/hdinsight-hadoop-hue-linux/hue_script_action.png "Provide script action parameters for Hue")
   
   * **NAME**: Enter a friendly name for the script action.
   * **SCRIPT URI**: https://hdiconfigactions.blob.core.windows.net/linuxhueconfigactionv02/install-hue-uber-v02.sh
   * **HEAD**: Check this option
   * **WORKER**: Leave this blank.
   * **ZOOKEEPER**: Leave this blank.
   * **PARAMETERS**: Leave this blank.
3. At the bottom of the **Script Actions**, use the **Select** button to save the configuration. Finally, use the **Select** button at the bottom of the **Optional Configuration** blade to save the optional configuration information.
4. Continue provisioning the cluster as described in [Provision HDInsight clusters on Linux](hdinsight-hadoop-provision-linux-clusters.md#portal).

## Use Hue with HDInsight clusters
SSH Tunneling is the only way to access Hue on the cluster once it is running. Tunneling via SSH allows the traffic to go directly to the headnode of the cluster where Hue is running. After the cluster has finished provisioning, use the following steps to use Hue on an HDInsight Linux cluster.

1. Use the information in [Use SSH Tunneling to access Ambari web UI, ResourceManager, JobHistory, NameNode, Oozie, and other web UI's](hdinsight-linux-ambari-ssh-tunnel.md) to create an SSH tunnel from your client system to the HDInsight cluster, and then configure your Web browser to use the SSH tunnel as a proxy.
2. Once you have created an SSH tunnel and configured your browser to proxy traffic through it, you must find the host name of the head node. Use the following steps to get this information from Ambari:
   
   1. In a browser, go to https://CLUSTERNAME.azurehdinsight.net. When prompted, use the Admin username and password to authenticate to the site.
   2. From the menu at the top of the page, select **Hosts**.
   3. Select the entry that begins with **hn0**. When the page opens, the host name will be displayed at the top. The format of the host name is **hn0-CLUSTERNAME.randomcharacters.cx.internal.cloudapp.net**. This is the host name you must use when connecting to Hue.
3. Once you have created an SSH tunnel and configured your browser to proxy traffic through it, use the browser to open the Hue portal at http://HOSTNAME:8888. Replace HOSTNAME with the name you obtained from Ambari in the previous step.
   
   > [!NOTE]
   > When you log in for the first time, you will be prompted to create an account to log into the Hue portal. The credentials you specify here will be limited to the portal and are not related to the admin or SSH user credentials you specified while provision the cluster.

### Run a Hive query
1. From the Hue portal, click **Query Editors**, and then click **Hive** to open the Hive editor.
   
    ![Use Hive](./media/hdinsight-hadoop-hue-linux/HDI.Hue.Portal.Hive.png "Use Hive")
2. On the **Assist** tab, under **Database**, you should see **hivesampletable**. This is a sample table that is shipped with all Hadoop clusters on HDInsight. Enter a sample query in the right pane and see the output on the **Results** tab in the pane below, as shown in the screen capture.
   
    ![Run Hive query](./media/hdinsight-hadoop-hue-linux/HDI.Hue.Portal.Hive.Query.png "Run Hive query")
   
    You can also use the **Chart** tab to see a visual representation of the result.

### Browse the cluster storage
1. From the Hue portal, click **File Browser** in the top-right corner of the menu bar.
2. By default the file browser opens at the **/user/myuser** directory. Click the forward slash right before the user directory in the path to go to the root of the Azure storage container associated with the cluster.
   
    ![Use file browser](./media/hdinsight-hadoop-hue-linux/HDI.Hue.Portal.File.Browser.png "Use file browser")
3. Right-click on a file or folder to see the available operations. Use the **Upload** button in the right corner to upload files to the current directory. Use the **New** button to create new files or directories.

> [!NOTE]
> The Hue file browser can only show the contents of the default container associated with the HDInsight cluster. Any additional storage accounts/containers that you might have associated with the cluster will not be accessible using the file browser. However, the additional containers associated with the cluster will always be accessible for the Hive jobs. For example, if you enter the command `dfs -ls wasbs://newcontainer@mystore.blob.core.windows.net` in the Hive editor, you can see the contents of additional containers as well. In this command, **newcontainer** is not the default container associated with a cluster.

## Important considerations
1. The script used to install Hue installs it only on Head node 0 of the cluster.
2. During installation, multiple Hadoop services (HDFS, YARN, MR2, Oozie) are restarted for updating the configuration. After the script finishes installing Hue, it might take some time for other Hadoop services to start up. This might affect Hue's performance initially. Once all services start up, Hue will be fully functional.
3. Hue does not understand Tez jobs, which is the current default for Hive. If you want to use MapReduce as the Hive execution engine, update the script to use the following command in your script:
   
     set hive.execution.engine=mr;
4. With Linux clusters, you can have a scenario where your services are running on head node 0 while the Resource Manager could be running on head node 1. Such a scenario might result in errors (shown below) when using Hue to view details of RUNNING jobs on the cluster. However, you can view the job details when the job has completed.
   
   ![Hue portal error](./media/hdinsight-hadoop-hue-linux/HDI.Hue.Portal.Error.png "Hue portal error")
   
   This is due to a known issue. As a workaround, modify Ambari so that the active Resource Manager also runs on head node 0.
5. Hue understands WebHDFS while HDInsight clusters use Azure Storage using `wasbs://`. So, the custom script used with script action installs WebWasb, which is a WebHDFS-compatible service for talking to WASB. So, even though the Hue portal says HDFS in places (like when you move your mouse over the **File Browser**), it should be interpreted as WASB.
