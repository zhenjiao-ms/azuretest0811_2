# Performance considerations for Traffic Manager
This page explains performance considerations using Traffic Manager. Scenarios like: You have a website in US region and one in Asia and one of them is failing health check for traffic manager probes, all of your users will be directed the healthy region, and the behavior can appear as    performance problem, but it would be an expected behavior based on the distance for the user request.

## Important note about how Traffic Manager works
* Traffic Manager essentially only does one thing – DNS resolution.  This means that the only performance impact that Traffic Manager can have on your website is the initial DNS lookup.
* A point of clarification about the Traffic Manager DNS lookup.  Traffic Manager populates, and regularly updates, the normal Microsoft DNS root servers based on your policy and the probe results.  So even during the initial DNS lookup there is no involvement by Traffic Manager since the DNS request is handled by the normal Microsoft DNS root servers.  If Traffic Manager goes ‘down’ (ie. a failure in the VMs doing the policy probing and DNS updating) then there will be no impact to your Traffic Manager DNS name since the entries in the Microsoft DNS servers will still be preserved – the only impact will be that probing and updating based on policy will not happen (ie. if your primary site goes down, Traffic Manager will not be able to update DNS to point to your failover site).
* Traffic does NOT flow through Traffic Manager.  There are no Traffic Manager servers acting as a middle-man between your clients and your Azure hosted service.  Once the DNS lookup is finished then Traffic Manager is completely removed from the communication between client and server.
* DNS lookup is very fast, and is cached.  The initial DNS lookup will depend on the client and their configured DNS servers, by typically a client can do a DNS lookup in ~50 ms (see http://www.solvedns.com/dns-comparison/).  Once the first lookup is done the results will be cached for the DNS TTL, which for Traffic Manager is default of 300 seconds.
* The Traffic Manager policy you choose (performance, failover, round robin) has no influence on the DNS performance.  Your performance policy can negatively impact your user’s experience, for example if you send US users to a service hosed in Asia, but this performance issue is not caused by Traffic Manager.

## Testing Traffic Manager Performance
There are a few publicly available websites that you can use to determine your Traffic Manager performance and behavior.  These sites are useful to determine the DNS latency and which of your hosted services your users around the world are being directed to.  Keep in mind that most of these tools do not cache the DNS results so running the tests multiple times will show the full DNS lookup, whereas clients connecting to your Traffic Manager endpoint will only see the full DNS lookup performance impact once during the TTL duration.

## Sample tools to measure performance
One of the simplest tools is WebSitePulse.  Enter the URL and you will see statistics such as DNS resolution time, First Byte, Last Byte, and other performance statistics.  You can choose from three different locations to test your site from.  In this example you will see that the first execution shows that first DNS lookup time takes 0.204 sec.  The second time we run this test on the same Traffic Manager endpoint the DNS lookup time takes 0.002 sec since the results are already cached.

Another really useful tool to get DNS resolution time from multiple geographic regions simultaneously is Watchmouse’s Check Website tool.  Enter the URL and you will see DNS resolution time, connection time, and speed from several geo locations.  This is also handy to test the Traffic Manager Performance policy to see which hosted service your different users around the world are being sent to.

http://tools.pingdom.com/ – This will test a website and provide performance statistics for each element on the page on a visual graph.  If you switch to the Page Analysis tab you can see the percentage of time spent doing DNS lookup.

http://www.whatsmydns.net/ – This site will do a DNS lookup from 20 different geo locations and display the results on a map.  This is a great visual representation to help determine which hosted service your clients will connect to.

http://www.digwebinterface.com – Similar to the watchmouse site, but this one shows more detailed DNS information including CNAMEs and A records.  Make sure you check the ‘Colorize output’ and ‘Stats’ under options, and select ‘All’ under Nameservers.
