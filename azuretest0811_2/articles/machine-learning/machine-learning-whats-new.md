# What's New in Azure Machine Learning
The July 2016 Microsoft Azure Machine Learning (ML) updates provide the following features:

* Web services are now managed as Azure resources managed through [Azure Resource Manager](../resource-group-overview.md) interfaces, allowing for the following enhancements:
  * There are new [REST APIs](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/Dn950030.aspx) to deploy and manage your Resource Manager based web services.
  * There is a new [Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Web Services](https://services.azureml.net/) portal that provides one place to manage all aspects of your web service.
* Incorporates a new subscription-based, multi-region web service deployment model using Resource Manager based APIs leveraging the Resource Manager Resource Provider for Web Services.
* Introduces new [pricing plans](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/machine-learning/) and plan management capabilities using the new Resource Manager RP for Billing.
  * You can now [deploy your web service to multiple regions](machine-learning-how-to-deploy-to-multiple-regions.md) without needing to create a new subscription in each region.
* Provides web service [usage statistics](machine-learning-manage-new-webservice.md).
* Simplifies testing of Azure ML RRS function using sample data.
* Provides a new BES test page with sample data and job submission history.

In addition, the Machine Learning studio has been updated to allow you to deploy to the new web service model or continue to deploy to the classic web service model.
