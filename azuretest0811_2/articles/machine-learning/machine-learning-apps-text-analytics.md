# Machine Learning APIs: Text Analytics for Sentiment, Key Phrase Extraction, Language Detection and Topic Detection
> [!NOTE]
> This guide is for version 1 of the API. For version 2, [**refer to this document**](../cognitive-services/cognitive-services-text-analytics-quick-start.md). Version 2 is now the preferred version of this API.

## Overview
The Text Analytics API is a suite of text analytics [web services](https://datamarket.azure.com/dataset/amla/text-analytics) built with Azure Machine Learning. The API can be used to analyze unstructured text for tasks such as sentiment analysis, key phrase extraction, language detection and topic detection. No training data is needed to use this API: just bring your text data. This API uses advanced natural language processing techniques to deliver best in class predictions.

You can see text analytics in action on our [demo site](https://text-analytics-demo.azurewebsites.net/), where you will also find [samples](https://text-analytics-demo.azurewebsites.net/Home/SampleCode) on how to implement text analytics in C# and Python.

## Sentiment analysis
The API returns a numeric score between 0 & 1. Scores close to 1 indicate positive sentiment, while scores close to 0 indicate negative sentiment. Sentiment score is generated using classification techniques. The input features to the classifier include n-grams, features generated from part-of-speech tags, and word embeddings. Currently, English is the only supported language.

## Key phrase extraction
The API returns a list of strings denoting the key talking points in the input text. We employ techniques from Microsoft Office's sophisticated Natural Language Processing toolkit. Currently, English is the only supported language.

## Language detection
The API returns the detected language and a numeric score between 0 & 1. Scores close to 1 indicate 100% certainty that the identified language is true. A total of 120 languages are supported.

## Topic detection
This is a newly released API which returns the top detected topics for a list of submitted text records. A topic is identified with a key phrase, which can be one or more related words. This API requires a minimum of 100 text records to be submitted, but is designed to detect topics across hundreds to thousands of records. Note that this API charges 1 transaction per text record submitted. The API is designed to work well for short, human written text such as reviews and user feedback.

## API Definition
### Headers
Ensure that you include the correct headers in your request, which should be as follows:

    Authorization: Basic <creds>
    Accept: application/json

    Where <creds> = ConvertToBase64(“AccountKey:” + yourActualAccountKey);  

You can find your account key from your account in the [Azure Data Market](https://datamarket.azure.com/account/keys). Note that currently only JSON is accepted for input and output formats. XML is not supported.

## Batch APIs
The Text Analytics service allows you to do sentiment and key-phrase extractions in batch mode. Note that each of the records scored counts as one transaction. As an example, if you request sentiment for 1000 records in a single call, 1000 transactions will be deducted.

Note that the IDs entered into the system are the IDs returned by the system. The web service does not check that these IDs are unique. It is the responsibility of the caller to verify uniqueness. 

### GetSentimentBatch

       }],
       "Errors": []
    }

## Topic Detection APIs
This is a newly released API which returns the top detected topics for a list of submitted text records. A topic is identified with a key phrase, which can be one or more related words. Note that this API charges 1 transaction per text record submitted.

This API requires a minimum of 100 text records to be submitted, but is designed to detect topics across hundreds to thousands of records.

### Topics – Submit job
**URL**

    https://api.datamarket.azure.com/data.ashx/amla/text-analytics/v1/StartTopicDetection

**Example request**

In the POST call below, we are requesting topics for a set of 100 articles, where the first and last input articles are shown, and two StopPhrases are included.

    POST https://api.datamarket.azure.com/data.ashx/amla/text-analytics/v1/StartTopicDetection HTTP/1.1

Request body:

    {"Inputs":[
        {"Id":"1","Text":"I loved the food at this restaurant"},
        ...,
        {"Id":"100","Text":"I hated the decor"}
    ],
    "StopPhrases":[
        "restaurant", “visitor"
    ]}

In the response below, you get the JobId for the submitted job:

    {
        "odata.metadata":"<url>",
        "JobId":"<JobId>"
    }

A list of single word or multiple word phrases which should not be returned as topics. Can be used to filter out very generic topics. For example, in a dataset about hotel reviews, "hotel" and "hostel" may be sensible stop phrases.  

### Topics – Poll for job results
**URL**

    https://api.datamarket.azure.com/data.ashx/amla/text-analytics/v1/GetTopicDetectionResult

**Example request**

Pass the JobId returned from the ‘Submit job’ step to fetch the results. We recommend that you call this endpoint every minute until Status=’Complete’ in the response. It will take around 10 mins for a job to complete, or longer for jobs with many thousands of records.

    GET https://api.datamarket.azure.com/data.ashx/amla/text-analytics/v1/GetTopicDetectionResult?JobId=<JobId>


While it is processing, the response will be as follows:

    {
        "odata.metadata":"<url>",
        "Status":"Running",
         "TopicInfo":[],
        "TopicAssignment":[],
        "Errors":[]
    }


The API returns output in JSON format in the following format:

    {
        "odata.metadata":"<url>",
        "Status":"Finished",
        "TopicInfo":[
        {
            "TopicId":"ed00480e-f0a0-41b3-8fe4-07c1593f4afd",
            "Score":8.0,
            "KeyPhrase":"food"
        },
        ...
        {
            "TopicId":"a5ca3f1a-fdb1-4f02-8f1b-89f2f626d692",
            "Score":6.0,
            "KeyPhrase":"decor"
            }
          ],
        "TopicAssignment":[
        {
            "Id":"1",
            "TopicId":"ed00480e-f0a0-41b3-8fe4-07c1593f4afd",
            "Distance":0.7809
        },
        ...
        {
            "Id":"100",
            "TopicId":"a5ca3f1a-fdb1-4f02-8f1b-89f2f626d692",
            "Distance":0.8034
        }
        ],
        "Errors":[]


The properties for each part of the response are as follows:

**TopicInfo properties**

| Key | Description |
|:--- |:--- |
| TopicId |A unique identifier for each topic. |
| Score |Count of records assigned to topic. |
| KeyPhrase |A summarizing word or phrase for the topic. Can be 1 or multiple words. |

**TopicAssignment properties**
