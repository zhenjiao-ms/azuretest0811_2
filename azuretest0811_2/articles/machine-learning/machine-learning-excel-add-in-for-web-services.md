# Excel Add-in for Azure Machine Learning web services
Excel makes it easy to call web services directly without the need to write any code.

## Steps to Use an Existing Web Service in the Workbook
1. Open the [sample Excel file](http://aka.ms/amlexcel-sample-2), which contains the Excel add-in and data about passengers on the Titanic.
2. Choose the web service by clicking it - "Titanic Survivor Predictor (Excel Add-in Sample) [Score]" in this example.
   
    ![Select web service](./media/machine-learning-excel-add-in-for-web-services/image1.png)
3. This will take you to the **Predict** section.  This workbook already contains sample data, but for a blank workbook you can select a cell in Excel and click **Use sample data**.
4. Select the data with headers and click the input data range icon.  Make sure the "My data has headers" box is checked.
5. Under **Output**, enter the cell number where you want the output to be, e.g. "H1" here.
6. Click **Predict**.

## Steps to Add a New Web Service
Publish a web service ([this page](machine-learning-walkthrough-5-publish-web-service.md) explains how to do it) or use an existing web service.

Get the API key for your web service. Where you do this depends on whether you published a classic web service of a new web service.

**Classic Web Service** 

1. In Machine Learning Studio, click the **WEB SERVICES** section in the left pane, and then select the web service.
   
    ![Studio select web service](./media/machine-learning-excel-add-in-for-web-services/image4.png)
2. Copy the API key for the web service.

3. On the **DASHBOARD** tab for the web service, click the **REQUEST/RESPONSE** link.
4. Look for the **Request URI** section.  Copy and save the URL.

**New Web Service**

1. In the Azure Machine Learning Web services portal, click **Web Services**, then select your web service. 
2. Click **Consume**.
3. Look for the **Basic consumption info** section.  Copy and save the **Primary Key** and the **Request-Response** URL.

## Steps to Add a New Web Service
1. Publish a web service ([this page](machine-learning-walkthrough-5-publish-web-service.md) explains how to do it) or use an existing web service.
2. In Excel, go to the **Web Services** section (if you are in the **Predict** section, click the back arrow to go to the list of web services).
   
    ![Go to web service selection](./media/machine-learning-excel-add-in-for-web-services/image3.png)
3. Click **Add Web Service**.
4. Paste the URL into the Excel add-in text box labeled **URL**.
5. Paste the API/Primary key into the text box labeled **API key**.
6. Click **Add**.

7. To use the web service, follow the directions above, "Steps to Use an Existing Web Service".

## Sharing Your Workbook
If you save your workbook, then the API/Primary key for the web services you have added is also saved. That means you should only share the workbook with individuals you trust.
