# Vehicle telemetry analytics solution template PowerBI Dashboard setup instructions
This **menu** links to the chapters in this playbook. 

[!INCLUDE [cap-vehicle-telemetry-playbook-selector](../../includes/cap-vehicle-telemetry-playbook-selector.md)]

The Vehicle Telemetry Analytics solution showcases how car dealerships, automobile manufacturers and insurance companies can leverage the capabilities of Cortana Intelligence to gain real-time and predictive insights on vehicle health and driving habits to drive improvements in the area of customer experience, R&D and marketing campaigns. 
This document contains step by step instructions on how you can configure the PowerBI reports and dashboard once the solution is deployed in your subscription. 

## Prerequisites
1. Deploy the Vehicle Telemetry Analytics solution by navigating to [https://gallery.cortanaanalytics.com/SolutionTemplate/Vehicle-Telemetry-Analytics-3](https://gallery.cortanaanalytics.com/SolutionTemplate/Vehicle-Telemetry-Analytics-3)  
2. [Install Microsoft Power BI Desktop](http://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=45331)
3. An [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/). If you don't have an Azure subscription, get started with Azure free subscription
4. Microsoft PowerBI account

## Cortana Intelligence Suite Components
As part of the Vehicle Telemetry Analytics solution template, the following Cortana Intelligence services are deployed in your subscription.

* **Event Hubs** for ingesting millions of vehicle telemetry events into Azure.
* **Stream Analytic**s for gaining real-time insights on vehicle health and persists that data into long-term storage for richer batch analytics.
* **Machine Learning** for anomaly detection in real-time and batch processing to gain predictive insights.
* **HDInsight** is leveraged to transform data at scale
* **Data Factory** handles orchestration, scheduling, resource management and monitoring of the batch processing pipeline.

**Power BI** gives this solution a rich dashboard for real-time data and predictive analytics visualizations. 

The solution uses two different data sources: **Simulated vehicle signals and diagnostic dataset** and **vehicle catalog**.

A vehicle telematics simulator is included as part of this solution. It emits diagnostic information and signals corresponding to the state of the vehicle and driving pattern at a given point in time. 

The Vehicle Catalog is a reference dataset containing VIN to model mapping

## PowerBI Dashboard Preparation
### Deployment
Once the deployment is completed, you should see the below diagram with all of these components marked in GREEN. 

* Click on the arrow on the upper right of the green nodes to navigate to the corresponding services to validate whether all of these have deployed successfully.
* Click on the arrow on the upper right on the Vehicle Telematics Simulator node to download the data simulator package. Save and extract the files locally on your machine. 

![](./media/cortana-analytics-playbook-vehicle-telemetry-powerbi-dashboard/1-deployed-components.png)

Now, you are ready to configure the PowerBI dashboard with rich visualizations to gain real-time and predictive insights on vehicle health and driving habits. It takes about 45 minutes to an hour to create all the reports and configure the dashboard. 

### Setup Power BI Real-Time Dashboard
**Generate simulated data**

1. On your local machine, go to the folder where you extracted the Vehicle Telematics Simulator package ![](./media/cortana-analytics-playbook-vehicle-telemetry-powerbi-dashboard/2-vehicle-telematics-simulator-folder.png)
2. Execute the application ***CarEventGenerator.exe***.
3. It emits diagnostic information and signals corresponding to the state of the vehicle and driving pattern at a given point in time. This is published to an Azure Event Hub instance that is configured as part of your deployment.

![](./media/cortana-analytics-playbook-vehicle-telemetry-powerbi-dashboard/3-vehicle-telematics-diagnostics.png)

**Start the real-time dashboard application**

An application is included as part of the solution to generate the real-time dashboard in PowerBI. This application is listening to an Event Hub instance where Stream Analytics is publishing the events in a continuously pattern. For every event that this application received, it processes the data using Machine Learning Request-Response scoring endpoint and the resultant dataset is published to the PowerBI push API’s for visualization. 

To download the application:

1. Click on the PowerBI node on the diagram view and click the **Download Real-time Dashboard Application**’ link on the properties pane.![](./media/cortana-analytics-playbook-vehicle-telemetry-powerbi-dashboard/vehicle-telemetry-dashboard-new1.png)
2. Extract and save the application locally ![](./media/cortana-analytics-playbook-vehicle-telemetry-powerbi-dashboard/4-real-time-dashboard-application.png)
3. Execute the application **RealtimeDashboardApp.exe**
4. Provide valid Power BI credentials, sign in and click **Accept**

   ![](./media/cortana-analytics-playbook-vehicle-telemetry-powerbi-dashboard/6-powerbi-dashboard-permissions.png)

### Configure PowerBI reports
The real-time reports and the dashboard takes about 30-45 minutes to complete. 
Browse to [http://powerbi.com](http://powerbi.com) and login.

![](./media/cortana-analytics-playbook-vehicle-telemetry-powerbi-dashboard/6-1-powerbi-signin.png)

A new dataset will be generated in Power BI. Click on the **ConnectedCarsRealtime** dataset.

![](./media/cortana-analytics-playbook-vehicle-telemetry-powerbi-dashboard/7-select-connected-cars-realtime-dataset.png)

Save the blank report using **Ctrl + s**.

![](./media/cortana-analytics-playbook-vehicle-telemetry-powerbi-dashboard/8-save-blank-report.png)

Provide report name *Vehicle Telemetry Analytics Real time - Reports*.

![](./media/cortana-analytics-playbook-vehicle-telemetry-powerbi-dashboard/9-provide-report-name.png)

## Real-time reports
There are 3 real-time reports in this solution:

1. Vehicles in operation
2. Vehicles Requiring Maintenance
3. Vehicles Health Statistics

You can choose to configure all the 3 real-time reports or stop after any stage and proceed to the next section of configuring the batch reports. We recommend you to create all the 3 reports to visualize the full insights of the real-time path of the solution.

### Pin visualizations from the reports to the real-time dashboard
Create a blank dashboard by clicking on the plus icon next to Dashboards. You can name it “Vehicle Telemetry Analytics Dashboard”

![Connected Cars-Dashboard](./media/cortana-analytics-playbook-vehicle-telemetry-powerbi-dashboard/connected-cars-3.5.png)

Pin the visualization from the above reports to the dashboard. 

![Connected Cars-Dashboard](./media/cortana-analytics-playbook-vehicle-telemetry-powerbi-dashboard/connected-cars-3.6.png)

The dashboard should look as shown below when all the 3 reports are created and the corresponding visualizations are pinned to the dashboard. Your dashboard could look different if you have not created all the reports. 

![Connected Cars-Dashboard](./media/cortana-analytics-playbook-vehicle-telemetry-powerbi-dashboard/connected-cars-4.0.png)

Congratulations!! You have successfully created the real-time dashboard. As you continue to execute CarEventGenerator.exe and RealtimeDashboardApp.exe, you should see live updates on the dashboard. 
It should take about 10 to 15 minutes to complete the below steps.

## Setup Power BI batch processing dashboard
Note: It takes about 2 hours (from the successful completion of the deployment)  for the end to end batch processing pipeline to finish execution and process a year worth of generated data. Please wait before proceeding with the next steps.
