# Vehicle telemetry analytics solution playbook: deep dive into the solution
This **menu** links to the sections of this playbook: 

[!INCLUDE [cap-vehicle-telemetry-playbook-selector](../../includes/cap-vehicle-telemetry-playbook-selector.md)]

This section drills down into the details of each one of the stages depicted in the Solution Architecture with instructions and pointers for customization. 

## Data Sources
The solution uses two different data sources:

* **simulated vehicle signals and diagnostic dataset** and 
* **vehicle catalog**

A vehicle telematics simulator is included as part of this solution. It emits diagnostic information and signals corresponding to the state of the vehicle and driving pattern at a given point in time. Click [Vehicle Telematics Simulator](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=717075) to download the **Vehicle Telematics Simulator Visual Studio Solution** for customizations based on your requirements. The vehicle catalog contains a reference dataset with a VIN to model mapping.

## Ingestion
Combinations of Azure Event Hubs, Stream Analytics and Data Factory are leveraged to ingest the vehicle signals and the diagnostic events and real-time and batch analytics. All these components are created and configured as part of the solution deployment. 

### Real-time analysis
The events generated by the Vehicle Telematics Simulator are published to the Event Hub using the Event Hub SDK. The Stream Analytics job ingests these events from the Event Hub and processes the data in real-time to analyze the vehicle health.

*Figure 6 - Stream analytics job processing data*

The stream analytics job ingests data from the Event Hub, performs a join with the reference data to map the vehicle VIN to the corresponding model and also persists them into Azure blob storage for rich batch analytics. The below stream analytics query is used to persist the data into Azure blob storage.

*Figure 7 - Stream analytics job query for data ingestion*

### Batch analysis
We are also generating an additional volume of simulated vehicle signals and diagnostic dataset for richer batch analytics. This is required to ensure a good representative data volume for batch processing. For this purpose, we are using a pipeline named "PrepareSampleDataPipeline" in the Azure Data Factory workflow to generate one year's worth of simulated vehicle signals and diagnostic dataset. Click [Data Factory custom activity](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=717077) to download the Data Factory custom DotNet activity Visual Studio solution for customizations based on your requirements.

*Figure 8 - Prepare Sample data for batch processing workflow*

The pipeline consists of a custom ADF .Net Activity, show below:

![](./media/cortana-analytics-playbook-vehicle-telemetry-deep-dive/fig9-vehicle-telematics-prepare-sample-data-pipeline.png) 

*Figure 9 - PrepareSampleDataPipeline*

Once the pipeline executes successfully and "RawCarEventsTable" dataset is marked "Ready", one-year worth of simulated vehicle signals and diagnostic data are produced. You will see the following folder and file created in your storage account under the "connectedcar" container:

The raw semi-structured vehicle signals and diagnostic dataset is partitioned in the data preparation step into a YEAR/MONTH format for efficient querying and scalable long term storage (*i.e.*, it enables faulting over from one blob account to the next as the first fills up). The output data (labeled *PartitionedCarEventsTable*) is to be kept for a long period as the foundational/”rawest” form of data in the customer's “Data Lake”.  The input data to this pipeline would typically be discarded as the output data has full fidelity to the input - it's just stored (partitioned) better for subsequent use.

![](./media/cortana-analytics-playbook-vehicle-telemetry-deep-dive/fig11-vehicle-telematics-partition-car-events-workflow.png)

*Figure 11 – Partition Car Events workflow*

The raw data is partitioned using a Hive HDInsight activity in "PartitionCarEventsPipeline". A year's worth of sample data generated in step 1 is partitioned by YEAR/MONTH to generate vehicle signals and diagnostic data partitions corresponding to each month (total 12 partitions) in a year.

The data is now optimized, is more manageable and ready for further processing to gain rich batch insights. 

## Data Analysis
In this section, you will see how we have used the combination of Azure Stream Analytics, Azure Machine Learning, Azure Data Factory and Azure HDInsight for rich advanced analytics on vehicle health and driving habits.  There are 3 sub-sections here:

1. **Machine Learning**: This sub-section contains information on the anomaly detection experiment that we have used in this solution to predict vehicles requiring servicing maintenance and vehicles requiring recalls due to safety issues
2. **Real-time analysis**: This sub-section contains information regarding the real-time analytics using the Stream Analytics Query Language and operationalizing the machine learning experiment in real-time using a custom application
3. **Batch analysis**: This sub-section contains information regarding the transforming and processing of the batch data using Azure HDInsight and Azure Machine Learning operationalized by Azure Data Factory

### Machine Learning
Our goal here is to predict the vehicles that require maintenance or recall based on certain heath statistics.  We make the following assumptions

* Vehicles require **servicing maintenance** if one of the following three conditions are true:
  
  * Tire pressure is low
  * Engine oil level is low
  * Engine temperature is high
* Vehicles may have a **safety issue** and require **recall** if one of the following conditions are true:
  
  * Engine temperature is high but outside temperature is low
  * Engine temperature is low but outside temperature is high

Based on the above requirements, we have created two separate models to detect anomalies, one for vehicle maintenance detection, and one for vehicle recall detection. In both these models, the built-in Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm is used for anomaly detection . 

**Maintenance detection model**
In the maintenance detection model, the model reports an anomaly if one of three indicators - tire pressure, engine oil, or engine temperature - satisfies its respective condition. As a result, we only need to consider these three variables in building the model. In our experiment in Azure Machine Learning, we first use a **Select Columns in Dataset** module to extract these three variables. Next we use the PCA-based anomaly detection module to build the anomaly detection model. 

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is an established technique in machine learning that can be applied to feature selection, classification, and anomaly detection. PCA converts a set of case containing possibly correlated variables, into a set of values called principal components. The key idea of PCA-based modeling is to project data onto a lower-dimensional space so that features and anomalies can be more easily identified.

In the case of anomaly detection, for each new input, the anomaly detector first computes its projection on the eigenvectors, and then computes the normalized reconstruction error. This normalized error is the anomaly score. The higher the error, the more anomalous the instance is. 

In the maintenance detection problem, each record can be considered as a point in a 3-dimensional space defined by tire pressure, engine oil, and engine temperature coordinates. To capture these anomalies, we can project the original data in the 3-dimensional onto a 2-dimensional space using PCA. Thus, we set the parameter Number of components to use in PCA to be 2. This parameter plays an important role in applying PCA-based anomaly detection. After projecting data using PCA, we can identify these anomalies more easily.

**Recall anomaly detection model**
In the recall anomaly detection model, we use the Select Columns in Dataset and PCA-based anomaly detection modules in a similar way. Specifically, we first extract three variables - engine temperature, outside temperature, and speed - using the **Select Columns in Dataset** module. We also include the speed variable since the engine temperature typically is correlated to the speed. Next we use PCA-based anomaly detection module to project the data from the 3-dimensional space onto a 2-dimensional space. The recall criteria are satisfied and so the vehicle requires recall when engine temperature and outside temperature are highly negatively correlated. Using PCA-based anomaly detection algorithm, we can capture the anomalies after performing PCA. 

Note that when training either model, we need to use normal data which does not require maintenance or recall as the input data to train the PCA-based anomaly detection model. In the scoring experiment, we use the trained anomaly detection model to detect if the vehicle requires maintenance or recall. 

### Real-time analysis
The following Stream Analytics SQL Query is used to get the average of all the important vehicle parameters like vehicle speed, fuel level, engine temperature, odometer reading, tire pressure, engine oil level etc to detect anomalies, issue alerts and determine the overall health conditions of vehicles operated in specific region and correlate it to demographics. 

![](./media/cortana-analytics-playbook-vehicle-telemetry-deep-dive/fig15-vehicle-telematics-stream-analytics-query-for-real-time-processing.png)

Figure 15 – Stream analytics query for real-time processing

All the averages are calculated over a 3 seconds TumblingWindow. We are using TubmlingWindow in this case since we require non-overlapping and contiguous time intervals. 

To learn more about all the "Windowing" capabilities in Azure Stream Analytics, click [Windowing (Azure Stream Analytics)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn835019.aspx).

**Real-time prediction**

An application is included as part of the solution to operationalize the machine learning model in real-time. This application called “RealTimeDashboardApp” is created and configured as part of the solution deployment. The application performs the following:

1. Listens to an Event Hub instance where Stream Analytics is publishing the events in a continuously pattern. ![](./media/cortana-analytics-playbook-vehicle-telemetry-deep-dive/fig16-vehicle-telematics-stream-analytics-query-for-publishing.png)*Figure 16 – Stream analytics query for publishing the data to an output Event Hub instance* 
2. For every event that this application receives: 
   
   * Processes the data using Machine Learning Request-Response Scoring (RRS) endpoint. The RRS endpoint is automatically published as part of the deployment.
   * The RRS output is published to a PowerBI dataset using the push APIs.

### Batch analysis
The goal here is to showcase how Contoso Motors is utilizing the Azure compute capabilities to harness big data to gain rich insights on driving pattern, usage behavior and vehicle health for:

* Improving the customer experience and make it cheaper by providing insights on driving habits and fuel efficient driving behaviors
* Learning proactively about customers and their driving patters to govern business decisions and provide the best in class products & services

In this solution, we are targeting the following metrics:

1. **Aggressive driving behavior** Identifies the trend of the models, locations, driving conditions, and time of the year to gain insights on aggressive driving pattern allowing Contoso Motors to use it for marketing campaigns, driving new personalized features and usage based insurance.
2. **Fuel efficient driving behavior** Identifies the trend of the models, locations, driving conditions, and time of the year to gain insights on fuel efficient driving pattern allowing Contoso Motors to use it for marketing campaigns, driving new features and proactive reporting to the drivers for cost effective and environment friendly driving habits. 
3. **Recall models** Identifies models requiring recalls by operationalizing the anomaly detection machine learning experiment

Let's look into the details of each of these metrics,

**Aggressive driving pattern**

The partitioned vehicle signals and diagnostic data are processed in the pipeline named "AggresiveDrivingPatternPipeline" using Hive to determine the models, location, vehicle and driving conditions etc that exhibits aggressive driving pattern.

**Recall Predictions**

The machine learning experiment is provisioned and published as a web service as part of the solution deployment. The batch scoring end point is leveraged in this workflow, registered as a data factory linked service and operationalized using data factory batch scoring activity.

![](./media/cortana-analytics-playbook-vehicle-telemetry-deep-dive/fig26-vehicle-telematics-machine-learning-endpoint.png) 

*Figure 26 – Machine learning endpoint registered as a linked service in data factory*

The registered linked service is used in the DetectAnomalyPipeline to score the data using the anomaly detection model. 

![](./media/cortana-analytics-playbook-vehicle-telemetry-deep-dive/fig27-vehicle-telematics-aml-batch-scoring.png) 

*Figure 27 – Azure Machine Learning Batch Scoring activity in data factory* 

There are few steps performed in this pipeline for data preparation so that it can be operationalized with the batch scoring web service.
