# Move Data to and from Azure Blob Storage
[!INCLUDE [cap-ingest-data-selector](../../includes/cap-ingest-data-selector.md)]

Guidance on technologies used to move data to and/or from Azure Blob storage are linked here:

[!INCLUDE [blob-storage-tool-selector](../../includes/machine-learning-blob-storage-tool-selector.md)]

Which method is best for you will depend on your scenario. The [Scenarios for advanced analytics in Azure Machine Learning](machine-learning-data-science-plan-sample-scenarios.md) article helps you determine the resources you need for a variety of data science workflows used in the advanced analytics process.

> [!NOTE]
> For a complete introduction to Azure blob storage, please refer to [Azure Blob Basics](../storage/storage-dotnet-how-to-use-blobs.md) and  [Azure Blob Service](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dd179376.aspx).
> 
> [!TIP]
> As an alternative, you can use [Azure Data Factory](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/data-factory/) to create and schedule a pipeline that will download data from Azure blob storage, pass it to a published Azure Machine Learning web service, receive the predictive analytics results, and upload the results to storage. For more information, see [Create predictive pipelines using Azure Data Factory and Azure Machine Learning](../data-factory/data-factory-azure-ml-batch-execution-activity.md).

## Prerequisites
This document assumes that you have an Azure subscription, a storage account and the corresponding storage key for that account. Before uploading/downloading data, you must know your Azure storage account name and account key.

* To set up an Azure subscription, see [Free one-month trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).
* For instructions on creating a storage account and for getting account and key information, see [About Azure storage accounts](../storage/storage-create-storage-account.md).
