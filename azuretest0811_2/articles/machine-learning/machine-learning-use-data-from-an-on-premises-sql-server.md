# Perform advanced analytics with Azure Machine Learning using data from an on-premises SQL Server database
Often enterprises that work with on-premises data would like to take advantage of the scale and agility of the cloud for their machine learning workloads. But they don't want to disrupt their current business processes and workflows by moving their on-premises data to the cloud. Azure Machine Learning now supports reading your data from an on-premises SQL Server database and then training and scoring a model with this data. You no longer have to manually copy and sync the data between the cloud and your on-premises server. Instead, the **Import Data** module in Azure Machine Learning Studio can now read directly from your on-premises SQL Server database for your training and scoring jobs. 

This article provides an overview of how to ingress on-premises SQL
server data into Azure Machine Learning. It assumes that you're familiar
with Azure Machine Learning concepts like workspaces, modules, datasets,
experiments, *etc*..

## Install the Microsoft Data Management Gateway
To access an on-premises SQL Server database in Azure Machine Learning you need
to download and install the Microsoft Data Management Gateway. When you configure the gateway connection in Machine Learning Studio you'll have the opportunity to
download and install the gateway using the **Download and register data
gateway** dialog described below.

You also can install the Data Management Gateway ahead of time by downloading and running the MSI setup package from the [Microsoft Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=39717). 
Choose the latest version, selecting either 32-bit or 64-bit as appropriate for your computer. The MSI can also be used to upgrade an existing Data Management Gateway to the latest version, with all settings preserved.

The gateway has the following prerequisites:

* The supported Windows operating system versions are Windows 7, Windows 8/8.1, Windows 10, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2012 R2.
* The recommended configuration for the gateway machine is at least 2 GHz, 4 cores, 8 GB RAM, and 80 GB disk.
* If the host machine hibernates, the gateway won’t be able to respond to data requests. Therefore, configure an appropriate power plan on the computer before installing the gateway. The gateway installation displays a message if the machine is configured to hibernate.
* Because copy activity occurs at a specific frequency, the resource usage (CPU, memory) on the machine also follows the same pattern with peak and idle times. Resource utilization also depends heavily on the amount of data being moved. When multiple copy jobs are in progress you'll observe resource usage go up during peak times. While the minimum configuration listed above is technically sufficient, you may want to have a configuration with more resources than the minimum configuration depending on your specific load for data movement.

You should consider the following when setting up and using a Data Management Gateway:

* You can install only one instance of Data Management Gateway on a single computer.
* You can use a single gateway for multiple on-premises data sources.
* You can connect multiple gateways on different computers to the same on-premises data source.
* You configure a gateway for only one workspace at a time. Gateways can’t be shared across workspaces at this time.
* You can configure multiple gateways for a single workspace. For example, you may want to use a gateway that's connected to your test data sources during development and a production gateway when you're ready to operationalize.
* The gateway does not need to be on the same machine as the data source, but staying closer to the data source reduces the time for the gateway to connect to the data source. We recommend that you install the gateway on a machine that's different from the one that hosts the on-premises data source so that the gateway and data source don't compete for resources.
* If you already have a gateway installed on your computer serving Power BI or Azure Data Factory scenarios, install a separate gateway for Azure Machine Learning on another computer. 
  
  > [!NOTE]
  > You can't run Data Management Gateway and Power BI Gateway on the same computer.
  > 
* You need to use the Data Management Gateway for Azure Machine Learning even if you are using Azure ExpressRoute for other data. You should treat your data source as an on-premises data source (that is behind a firewall) even when you use ExpressRoute, and use the Data Management Gateway to establish connectivity between Machine Learning and the data source. 

You can find detailed information on installation prerequisites,
installation steps, and troubleshooting tips in the article, [Move data between on-premises sources and cloud with
Data Management
Gateway](../data-factory/data-factory-move-data-between-onprem-and-cloud.md#considerations-for-using-data-management-gateway), beginning with the section, [Considerations for using Data Management Gateway](../data-factory/data-factory-move-data-between-onprem-and-cloud.md#considerations-for-using-data-management-gateway).

### Step 1: Create a gateway
The first step is to create and set up the gateway to access your
on-premises SQL database.

1. Login to [Azure Machine Learning
   Studio](https://studio.azureml.net/Home/) and select the workspace
   that you want to work in.
2. Click the **SETTINGS** blade on the left, and then click the **DATA
   GATEWAYS** tab at the top.
3. Click **NEW DATA GATEWAY** at the bottom of the screen.
   
   ![](media/machine-learning-use-data-from-an-on-premises-sql-server/new-data-gateway-button.png)
4. In the **New data gateway** dialog, enter the **Gateway Name** and
   optionally add a **Description**. Click the arrow on the bottom
   right hand corner to go to the next step of the configuration.
   
   ![](media/machine-learning-use-data-from-an-on-premises-sql-server/new-data-gateway-dialog-enter-name.png)
5. In the Download and register data gateway dialog, copy the GATEWAY
   REGISTRATION KEY to the clipboard.
   
   ![](media/machine-learning-use-data-from-an-on-premises-sql-server/download-and-register-data-gateway.png)
6. <span id="note-1" class="anchor"></span>If you have not yet
   downloaded and installed the Microsoft Data Management Gateway, then
   click **Download data management gateway**. This takes you to the
   Microsoft Download Center where you can select the gateway version
   you need, download it, and install it. You can find detailed information on installation prerequisites, installation steps, and troubleshooting tips in the beginning sections of the article [Move data between on-premises sources and cloud with Data Management Gateway](../data-factory/data-factory-move-data-between-onprem-and-cloud.md).
7. After the gateway is installed, the Data Management Gateway
   Configuration Manager will open and the **Register gateway** dialog
   is displayed. Paste the **Gateway Registration Key** that you copied
   to the clipboard and click **Register**.
8. If you already have a gateway installed, run the Data Management
   Gateway Configuration Manager, click **Change key**, paste the
   **Gateway Registration Key** that you copied to the clipboard, and
   click **OK**.
9. When the installation is complete, the **Register gateway** dialog
   for Microsoft Data Management Gateway Configuration Manager
   is displayed. Paste the GATEWAY REGISTRATION KEY that you copied to
   the clipboard above and click **Register**.
   
   ![](media/machine-learning-use-data-from-an-on-premises-sql-server/data-gateway-configuration-manager-register-gateway.png)
10. The gateway configuration is complete when the following values are
    set on the **Home** tab in Microsoft Data Management Gateway
    Configuration Manager:
    
    * **Gateway name** and **Instance name** are set to the name of
      the gateway.
    * **Registration** is set to **Registered**.
    * **Status** is set to **Started**.
    * The status bar the bottom displays **Connected to Data
      Management Gateway Cloud Service** along with a green
      check mark.
    
    ![](media/machine-learning-use-data-from-an-on-premises-sql-server/data-gateway-configuration-manager-registered.png)
    
    Azure Machine Learning Studio also gets updated when the registration is successful.
    
    ![](media\\machine-learning-use-data-from-an-on-premises-sql-server\\gateway-registered.png)
11. In the **Download and register data gateway** dialog, click the
    check mark to complete the setup. The **Settings** page displays the
    gateway status as "Online". In the right hand pane you'll find
    status and other useful information.
    
    ![](media\\machine-learning-use-data-from-an-on-premises-sql-server\\gateway-status.png)
12. In the Microsoft Data Management Gateway Configuration Manager
    switch to the **Certificate** tab. The certificate specified on this
    tab is used to encrypt/decrypt credentials for the on-premises data
    store that you specify in the portal. This is the default
    certificate generated. Microsoft recommends changing this to your
    own certificate that you back up in your certificate
    management system. Click **Change** to use your own
    certificate instead.
    
    ![](media\\machine-learning-use-data-from-an-on-premises-sql-server\\data-gateway-configuration-manager-certificate.png)
13. (optional) If you want to enable verbose logging in order to
    troubleshoot issues with the gateway, in the Microsoft Data
    Management Gateway Configuration Manager switch to the
    **Diagnostics** tab and check the **Enable verbose logging for
    troubleshooting purposes** option. The logging information can be
    found in the Windows Event Viewer under the **Applications and
    Services Logs** -&gt; **Data Management Gateway** node. You can also
    use the **Diagnostics** tab to test the connection to an on-premises
    data source using the gateway.
    
    ![](media\\machine-learning-use-data-from-an-on-premises-sql-server\\data-gateway-configuration-manager-verbose-logging.png)

This completes the gateway set up process in Azure Machine Learning.
You're now ready to use your on-premises data.

You can create and set up multiple gateways in Studio for each
workspace. For example, you may have a gateway that you want to connect
to your test data sources during development, and a different gateway
for your production data sources. Azure Machine Learning gives you the
flexibility to set up multiple gateways depending upon your corporate
environment. Currently you can’t share a gateway between workspaces and
only one gateway can be installed on a single computer. For more
considerations when installing the gateway, see [Considerations for
using Data Management
Gateway](../data-factory/data-factory-move-data-between-onprem-and-cloud.md#considerations-for-using-data-management-gateway)
in the article, [Move data between on-premises sources and cloud with
Data Management
Gateway](../data-factory/data-factory-move-data-between-onprem-and-cloud.md).

### Step 2: Use the gateway to read data from an on-premises data source
After you set up the gateway, you can add an **Import Data** module to
an experiment that inputs the data from the on-premises SQL Server database.

1. In Machine Learning Studio, select the **EXPERIMENTS** tab, click
   **+NEW** in the lower-left corner, and select **Blank Experiment**
   (or select one of several sample experiments available).
2. Find and drag the **Import Data** module to the experiment canvas.
3. Click **Save as** below the canvas. Enter "Azure Machine Learning
   On-Premises SQL Server Tutorial" for the experiment name, select the
   workspace, and click the **OK** check mark.
   
   ![](media\\machine-learning-use-data-from-an-on-premises-sql-server\\experiment-save-as.png)
4. Click the **Import Data** module to select it, then in the
   **Properties** pane to the right of the canvas, select "On-Premises
   SQL Database" in the **Data source** dropdown list.
5. Select the **Data gateway** you installed and registered. You can
   setup another gateway by selecting "(add new Data Gateway…)".
   
   ![](media\\machine-learning-use-data-from-an-on-premises-sql-server\\import-data-select-on-premises-data-source.png)
6. Enter the SQL **Database server name** and **Database name**, along
   with the SQL **Database query** you want to execute.
7. Click **Enter values** under **User name and password** and enter
   your database credentials. You can use Windows Integrated
   Authentication or SQL Server Authentication depending upon how your
   on-premises SQL Server is configured.
   
   ![](media\\machine-learning-use-data-from-an-on-premises-sql-server\\database-credentials.png)
   
   The message "values required" will change to "values set" with a green check mark. You just need to enter the credentials once unless the database information or password changes. Azure Machine Learning uses the certificate you provided when you installed the gateway to encrypt the credentials in the cloud. Azure will never store on-premises credentials without encryption.
   
   ![](media\\machine-learning-use-data-from-an-on-premises-sql-server\\import-data-properties-entered.png)
8. Click **RUN** to run the experiment.

Once the experiment finishes running you can visualize the data you
imported from the database by clicking the output port of the **Import
Data** module and selecting **Visualize**.

Once you finish developing your experiment, you can deploy and
operationalize your model. Using the Batch Execution Service, data from
the on-premises SQL Server database configured in the **Import Data** module will
be read and used for scoring. While you can use the Request Response
Service for scoring on-premises data, Microsoft recommends using the
[Excel Add-in](machine-learning-excel-add-in-for-web-services.md)
instead. Currently, writing to an on-premises SQL Server database through
**Export Data** is not supported either in your experiments or published
web services.
