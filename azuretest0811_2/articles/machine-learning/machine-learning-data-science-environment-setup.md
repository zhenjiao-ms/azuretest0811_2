# Set up data science environments for use in the Team Data Science Process
The Team Data Science Process uses a variety of data science environments for the storage, processing and analysis of data. They includes Azure Blob Storage, several types of Azure virtual machines, HDInsight (Hadoop) clusters, and Azure Machine Learning workspaces. The decision about which environment to use depends on the type and quantity of data to be modeled with machine learning, and the target destination for that data in the cloud. 

* For guidance on the questions to consider when making this decision, see [Plan Your Azure Machine Learning Data Science Environment](machine-learning-data-science-plan-your-environment.md). 
* For a catalog of some of the scenarios you might encounter when doing advanced analytics, see [Scenarios for the Team Data Science Process](machine-learning-data-science-plan-sample-scenarios.md)

This menu links to topics that describe how to set up the various data science environments used by the Team Data Science Process.

The **Microsoft Data Science Virtual Machine** is also available as an Azure virtual machine (VM) image pre-installed and configured with several popular tools that are commonly used for data analytics and machine learning. See [Provision the Microsoft Data Science Virtual Machine](machine-learning-data-science-provision-vm.md) for how to use this VM.
