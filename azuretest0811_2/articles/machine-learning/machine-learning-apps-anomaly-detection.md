# Machine Learning Anomaly Detection Service
## Overview
Anomaly Detection API is an example built with Azure Machine Learning that detects anomalies in time series data with numerical values that are uniformly spaced in time. 

This APIs can detect the following types of anomalous patterns in time series data:

* **Positive and negative trends**: For example, when monitoring memory usage in computing an upward trend may be of interest as it may be indicative of a memory leak,
* **Changes in the dynamic range of values**: For example, when monitoring the exceptions thrown by a cloud service, any changes in the dynamic range of values could indicate instability in the health of the service, and
* **Spikes and Dips**: For example, when monitoring the number of login failures in a service or number of checkouts in an e-commerce site, spikes or dips could indicate abnormal behavior.

These machine learning detectors track such changes in values over time and reports ongoing changes in their values as anomaly scores. They do not require adhoc threshold tuning and their scores can be used to control false positive rate. The anomaly detection API is useful in several scenarios like service monitoring by tracking KPIs over time, usage monitoring through metrics such as number of searches, numbers of clicks, performance monitoring through counters like memory, CPU, file reads, etc. over time.

The Anomaly Detection offering comes with useful tools to get you started. 

* The [web application](http://anomalydetection-aml.azurewebsites.net/) helps you evaluate and visualize the results of anomaly detection APIs on your  data. 
* The [sample code](http://adresultparser.codeplex.com/) shows how to programmatically access the API and parse the results in C#.

## API Definition
The service provides a REST based API over HTTPS that can be consumed in different ways including a web or mobile application, R, Python, Excel, etc.  You send your time series data to this service via a REST API call, and it runs a combination of the three anomaly types described above. The service runs on the Azure Machine Learning platform, which scales to your business needs seamlessly and provides SLAs.

### Headers
Ensure that you include the correct headers in your request, which should be as follows:

    Authorization: Basic <creds>
    Accept: application/json

    Where <creds> = ConvertToBase64(“AccountKey:” + yourActualAccountKey);  

You can find your account key from your account in the [Azure Data Market](https://datamarket.azure.com/account/keys). 

### Score API
The Score API is used for running anomaly detection on non-seasonal time series data. The API runs a number of anomaly detectors on the data and returns their anomaly scores. 
The figure below shows an example of anomalies that the Score API can detect. This time series has 2 distinct level changes, and 3 spikes. The red dots show the time at which the level change is detected, while the black dots show the detected spikes.

**URL**

    https://api.datamarket.azure.com/data.ashx/aml_labs/anomalydetection/v2/Score 

**Example request body**

In the request below, we send a time series (shown truncated) with data points from 3/1/2016 through 3/10/2016 and parameters of spike detectors to the API for detecting if any of these data points are anomalous. 

    {
      "data": [
        [ "9/21/2014 11:05:00 AM", "3" ],
        [ "9/21/2014 11:10:00 AM", "9.09" ],

      }
    }

The response to this will be :

        ]
      }"
    }

### ScoreWithSeasonality API
The ScoreWithSeasonality API is used for running anomaly detection on time series that have seasonal patterns. This API is useful to detect deviations in seasonal patterns.  

The following figure shows an example of anomalies detected in a seasonal time series. The time series has one spike (the 1st black dot), two dips (the 2nd black dot and one at the end), and one level change (red dot). Note that both the dip in the middle of the time series and the level change are only discernable after seasonal components are removed from the series.

### Output
The API runs all detectors on your time series data and returns anomaly scores and binary spike indicators for each point in time. The table below lists outputs from the API. 

| Outputs | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Time |Timestamps from raw data, or aggregated (and/or) imputed data if aggregation (and/or) missing data imputation is applied |
| OriginalData |Values from raw data, or aggregated (and/or) imputed data if aggregation (and/or) missing data imputation is applied |
| ProcessedData |Either of the following: <ul><li>Seasonally adjusted time series if significant seasonality has been detected and deseason option selected;</li><li>seasonally adjusted and detrended time series if significant seasonality has been detected and deseasontrend option selected</li><li>otherwise, this is the same as OriginalData</li> |
| TSpike |Binary indicator to indicate whether a spike is detected by TSpike Detector |
| ZSpike |Binary indicator to indicate whether a spike is detected by ZSpike Detector |
| Pscore |A floating number representing anomaly score on upward level change |
| Palert |1/0 value indicating there is an upward level change anomaly based on the input sensitivity |
| RPScore |A floating number representing anomaly score on bidirectional level change |
| RPAlert |1/0 value indicating there is an bi directional level change anomaly based on the input sensitivity |
| TScore |A floating number representing anomaly score on positive trend |
| TAlert |1/0 value indicating there is a positive trend anomaly based on the input sensitivity |

This output can be parsed using a [simple parser](https://adresultparser.codeplex.com/) - it has sample code that shows how to connect to the API and parse the output. The anomalies detected can be visualized on a dashboard and/or passed on to human experts for corrective actions or integrated into ticketing systems.
