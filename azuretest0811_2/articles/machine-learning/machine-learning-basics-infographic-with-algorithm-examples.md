# Downloadable Infographic: Machine learning basics with algorithm examples
Download this easy-to-understand infographic overview of machine learning basics. Learn about popular algorithms used to answer common machine learning questions. Algorithm examples help the machine learning beginner understand which algorithms to use and what they are used for.

## Popular algorithms in Machine Learning Studio
[Azure Machine Learning Studio](https://studio.azureml.net/) comes with a large library of algorithms for predictive analytics. The infographic shows popular families of algorithms: **regression**, **anomaly detection**, **clustering**, and **classification**.

[Cortana Intelligence Gallery](https://gallery.cortanaintelligence.com/) shows how these algorithms can be applied in many real-world solutions. Follow links in the infographic to see working examples.
