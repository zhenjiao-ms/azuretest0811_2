# Azure AD Domain Services (Preview) - Contact Us
## Contact Us
If you have issues with your managed domain, check to see if the steps outlined in the [Troubleshooting Guide](active-directory-ds-troubleshooting.md) resolve the issue. If you're still having trouble, feel free to reach out to us.

You may email us at: [Azure AD Domain Services Feedback](mailto:aaddsfb@microsoft.com).

Ensure that you include the following, so we can investigate the issue.

* The **DNS domain name** you've configured for your AAD Domain Services managed domain.
