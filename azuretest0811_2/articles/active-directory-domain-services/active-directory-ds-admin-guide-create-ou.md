# Create an Organizational Unit (OU) on an Azure AD Domain Services managed domain
Azure AD Domain Services managed domains include two built-in containers called 'AADDC Computers' and 'AADDC Users' respectively. The 'AADDC Computers' container has computer objects for all computers that are joined to the managed domain. The 'AADDC Users' container includes users and groups in the Azure AD tenant. Occasionally, it may be necessary to create service accounts on the managed domain in order to deploy workloads. For this purpose, you can create a custom Organizational Unit (OU) on the managed domain and create service accounts within that OU. This article shows you how to create an OU in your managed domain.

## Install AD administration tools on a domain-joined virtual machine for remote administration
Azure AD Domain Services managed domains can be managed remotely using familiar Active Directory administrative tools such as the Active Directory Administrative Center (ADAC) or AD PowerShell. Tenant administrators do not have privileges to connect to domain controllers on the managed domain via Remote Desktop. To administer the managed domain, install the AD administration tools feature on a virtual machine joined to the managed domain. Refer to the article titled [administer an Azure AD Domain Services managed domain](active-directory-ds-admin-guide-administer-domain.md) for instructions.

## Create an Organizational Unit on the managed domain
Now that the AD Administrative Tools are installed on the domain joined virtual machine, we can use these tools to create an organization unit on the managed domain. Perform the following steps.

> [!NOTE]
> Only members of the 'AAD DC Administrators' group have the required privileges to create a new OU. Ensure that you perform the following steps as a user who belongs to this group.

> 

1. From the Start screen, click on **Administrative Tools**. You should see the AD administrative tools installed on the virtual machine.

2. Click on **Active Directory Administrative Center**.

3. Click on the domain name in the left pane (eg. 'contoso100.com') to view the domain.

4. On the right side **Tasks** pane, click on **New** under the domain name node. In this example, we will click on **New** under the 'contoso100(local)' node on the right side **Tasks** pane, as shown below.

5. You should see the option to create an Organizational Unit. Click on **Organizational Unit** to launch the **Create Organizational Unit** dialog.
6. In the **Create Organizational Unit** dialog, specify a **Name** for the new OU. Provide a short description for the OU. You may also set the **Managed By** field for the OU. Click **OK** to create the new OU.

7. The newly created OU should now appear in the AD Administrative Center (ADAC).

## Permissions/Security for newly created OUs
By default, the user (member of the 'AAD DC Administrators' group) who created the new OU is granted administrative privileges (full control) over the OU. The user can then go ahead and grant privileges to other users or to the 'AAD DC Administrators' group as desired. As seen in the below screenshot, the user 'bob@domainservicespreview.onmicrosoft.com' who created the new 'MyCustomOU' organizational unit is granted full control over it.

## Notes on administering custom OUs
Now that you have created a custom OU, you can go ahead and create users, groups, computers and service accounts in this OU. You will not be able to move users or groups from the 'AAD DC Users' OU to custom OUs.

> [!WARNING]
> User accounts, groups, service accounts and computer objects that you create under custom OUs will not be available in your Azure AD tenant. In other words, these objects will not show up using the Azure AD Graph API or in the Azure AD UI. These objects will only be available in your Azure AD Domain Services managed domain.
