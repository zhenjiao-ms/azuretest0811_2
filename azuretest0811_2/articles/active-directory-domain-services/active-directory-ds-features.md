# Azure AD Domain Services *(Preview)*
## Features
The following features are available in the Azure AD Domain Services preview release.

* **Simple deployment experience:** You can enable Azure AD Domain Services for your Azure AD tenant using just a few clicks. Regardless of whether your Azure AD tenant is a cloud-tenant or synchronized with your on-premises directory, your managed domain can be provisioned quickly.
* **Support for domain-join:** You can easily domain join computers in the Azure virtual network that Azure AD Domain Services is available in. The domain join experience on Windows client and Server operating systems works seamlessly against domains serviced by Azure AD Domain Services. You can also use automated domain join tooling against such domains.
* **One domain instance per Azure AD directory:** You can create a single Active Directory domain for each Azure AD directory.
* **Create domains with custom names:** You can create domains with custom names (eg. contoso.local) using Azure AD Domain Services. This includes both verified as well as unverified domain names. Optionally, you can also create a domain with the built-in domain suffix (i.e. *.onmicrosoft.com) that is offered by your Azure AD directory.
* **Integrated with Azure AD:** You do not need to configure or manage replication to Azure AD Domain Services. User accounts, group memberships and user credentials (passwords) from your Azure AD directory are automatically available in Azure AD Domain Services. New users, groups or changes to attributes ocurring in your Azure AD tenant or in your on-premises directory are automatically synchronized to Azure AD Domain Services.
* **NTLM and Kerberos authentication:** With support for NTLM and Kerberos authentication, you can deploy applications that rely on Windows Integrated Authentication.
* **Use your corporate credentials/passwords:** Passwords for users in your Azure AD tenant work with Azure AD Domain Services. This means users in your organization can use their corporate credentials on the domain â€“ for domain joining machines, logging in interactively or over remote desktop, authenticating against the DC etc.
* **LDAP bind & LDAP read support:** You can use applications that rely on LDAP binds in order to authenticate users in domains serviced by Azure AD Domain Services. Additionally, applications that use LDAP read operations to query user/computer attributes from the directory can also work against Azure AD Domain Services.
* **Secure LDAP (LDAPS):** You can enable access to the directory over secure LDAP (LDAPS). Secure LDAP access is available within the virtual network by default. However, you can also optionally enable secure LDAP access over the internet.
* **Group Policy:** You can leverage a single built-in GPO each for the users and computers containers in order to enforce compliance with required security policies for user accounts as well as domain joined computers.
* **Manage DNS:** Members of the 'AAD DC Administrators' group can manage DNS for your Azure AD Domain Services managed domain using familiar DNS administration tools such as the DNS Administration MMC snap-in.
* **Create custom Organizational Units (OUs):** Members of the 'AAD DC Administrators' group can create custom OUs within the AAD Domain Services managed domain. These users are granted full administrative privileges over custom OUs, so they can add/remove service accounts, computers, groups etc. within these custom OUs.
* **Available in multiple Azure regions:** See the [Azure services by region](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/#services/) page to know the Azure regions in which Azure AD Domain Services are available.
* **High availability:** Azure AD Domain Services offer high availability for your domain. This offers the guarantee of higher service uptime and resilience to failures. Built-in health monitoring offers automated remediation from failures by spinning up new instances to replace failed instances and to provide continued service for your domain.
* **Use familiar management tools:** You can use familiar Windows Server Active Directory management tools such as the Active Directory Administrative Center or Active Directory PowerShell in order to administer domains provided by Azure AD Domain Services.
