# Configure Azure Diagnostic logging to Application Insights
When you set up a Cloud Services project or a Virtual Machine in Microsoft Azure, [Azure can generate a diagnostic log](../vs-azure-tools-diagnostics-for-cloud-services-and-virtual-machines.md). You can have this sent on to Application Insights so that you can analyze it along with diagnostic and usage telemetry sent from within the app by the Application Insights SDK. The Azure log includes events in the management of the app such as start, stop, crashes, as well as performance counters. The log also includes calls in the app to System.Diagnostics.Trace.

This article describes configuration of the diagnostic capture in detail.

You need Azure SDK 2.8 installed in Visual Studio.

## Get an Application Insights resource
For the best experience, [add the Application Insights SDK to each role of your Cloud Services app](app-insights-cloudservices.md), or [to whatever app you will run in your VM](app-insights-get-started.md). You can then send the diagnostic data to be  analyzed and displayed the same Application Insights resource.

Alternatively, if you don't want to use the SDK - for example, if the app is already live - you can just [create a new Application Insights resource](app-insights-create-new-resource.md) in the Azure portal. Choose **Azure Diagnostics** as the application type.

## Send Azure diagnostics to Application Insights
If you are able to update your app project, then in Visual Studio select each role, choose its Properties, and in the Configuration tab, select **Send diagnostics to Application Insights**.

If your app is already live, use Visual Studio's Server Explorer or Cloud Services explorer to open the properties of the app. Select **Send diagnostics to Application Insights**.

In each case you'll be asked for the details of the Application Insights resource you created.

[Learn more about setting up Application Insights for a Cloud Services app](app-insights-cloudservices.md).

## Configuring the Azure diagnostics adapter
Read on only if you want to select the parts of the log that you send to Application Insights. By default, everything is sent, including: Microsoft Azure events; performance counters; trace calls from the app to System.Diagnostics.Trace.

Azure diagnostics stores data to Azure Storage tables. However, you can also pipe all or a subset of the data to Application Insights by configuring "sinks" and "channels" in your configuration when using Azure Diagnostics extension 1.5 or later.

### Configure Application Insights as a Sink
When you use the role properties to set "Send data to Application Insights", the Azure SDK (2.8 or later) adds a `<SinksConfig>` element to the public [Azure Diagnostics configuration file](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn782207.aspx) of the role.

`<SinksConfig>` defines the additional sink where the Azure diagnostics data can be sent.  An example `SinksConfig` looks like this:

```xml

    <SinksConfig>
     <Sink name="ApplicationInsights">
      <ApplicationInsights>{Insert InstrumentationKey}</ApplicationInsights>
      <Channels>
        <Channel logLevel="Error" name="MyTopDiagData"  />
        <Channel logLevel="Verbose" name="MyLogData"  />
      </Channels>
     </Sink>
    </SinksConfig>

```

The `ApplicationInsights` element specifies the instrumentation key which identifies the Application Insights resource to which the Azure diagnostics data will be sent. When you select the resource, it is automatically populated based on the `APPINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATIONKEY` service configuration. (If you want to set it manually, get the key from the Essentials drop-down of the resource.)

`Channels` define the data that will be sent to the sink. The channel acts like a filter. The `loglevel` attribute lets you specify the log level that the channel will send. The available values are: `{Verbose, Information, Warning, Error, Critical}`.

### Send data to the sink
Send data to the Application Insights sink by adding the sinks attribute under the DiagnosticMonitorConfiguration node. Adding the sinks element to each node specifies that you want data collected from that node and any node under it to be sent to the sink specified.

For example, the default created by the Azure SDK is to send all the Azure diagnostic data:

```xml

    <DiagnosticMonitorConfiguration overallQuotaInMB="4096" sinks="ApplicationInsights">
```

But if you want to send only error logs, qualify the sink name with a channel name:

```xml

    <DiagnosticMonitorConfiguration overallQuotaInMB="4096" sinks="ApplicationInsights.MyTopDiagdata">
```

Notice that we're using the name of the Sink that we defined, together with the name of a channel that we defined above.

If you only wanted to send Verbose application logs to Application Insights then you would add the sinks attribute to the `Logs` node.

```xml

    <Logs scheduledTransferPeriod="PT1M" scheduledTransferLogLevelFilter="Verbose" sinks="ApplicationInsights.MyLogData"/>
```

You can also include multiple sinks in the configuration at different levels in the hierarchy. In that case the sink specified at the top level of the hierarchy acts as a global setting and the one specified at the individual element element acts like an override to that global setting.

Here is a complete example of the public configuration file that sends all errors to Application Insights (specified at the `DiagnosticMonitorConfiguration` node) and in addition Verbose level logs for the Application Logs (specified at the `Logs` node).

```xml

    <WadCfg>
     <DiagnosticMonitorConfiguration overallQuotaInMB="4096"
       sinks="ApplicationInsights.MyTopDiagData"> <!-- All info below sent to this channel -->
      <DiagnosticInfrastructureLogs />
      <PerformanceCounters>
        <PerformanceCounterConfiguration counterSpecifier="\Processor(_Total)\% Processor Time" sampleRate="PT3M" sinks="ApplicationInsights.MyLogData/>
        <PerformanceCounterConfiguration counterSpecifier="\Memory\Available MBytes" sampleRate="PT3M" />
        <PerformanceCounterConfiguration counterSpecifier="\Web Service(_Total)\Bytes Total/Sec" sampleRate="PT3M" />
      </PerformanceCounters>
      <WindowsEventLog scheduledTransferPeriod="PT1M">
        <DataSource name="Application!*" />
      </WindowsEventLog>
      <Logs scheduledTransferPeriod="PT1M" scheduledTransferLogLevelFilter="Verbose"
            sinks="ApplicationInsights.MyLogData"/>
       <!-- This specific info sent to this channel -->
     </DiagnosticMonitorConfiguration>

     <SinksConfig>
      <Sink name="ApplicationInsights">
        <ApplicationInsights>{Insert InstrumentationKey}</ApplicationInsights>
        <Channels>
          <Channel logLevel="Error" name="MyTopDiagData"  />
          <Channel logLevel="Verbose" name="MyLogData"  />
        </Channels>
      </Sink>
     </SinksConfig>
    </WadCfg>
```

There are some limitations to be aware of with this functionality:

* Channels are only meant to work with log type and not performance counters. If you specify a channel with a performance counter element it will be ignored.
* The log level for a channel cannot exceed the log level for what is being collected by Azure diagnostics. For example: you cannot collect Application Log errors in the Logs element and try to send Verbose logs to the Application Insight sync. The scheduledTransferLogLevelFilter attribute must always collect equal or more logs than the logs you are trying to send to a sink.
* You cannot send any blob data collected by Azure diagnostics extension to Application Insights. For example anything specified under the Directories node. For Crash Dumps the actual crash dump will still be sent to blob storage and only a notification that the crash dump was generated will be sent to Application Insights.
