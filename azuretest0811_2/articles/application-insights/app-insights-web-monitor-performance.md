# Monitor performance in web applications
*Application Insights is in preview.*

Make sure your application is performing well, and find out quickly about any failures. [Application Insights](app-insights-overview.md) will tell you about any performance issues and exceptions, and help you find and diagnose the root causes.

Application Insights can monitor both Java and ASP.NET web applications and services, WCF services. They can be hosted on-premise, on virtual machines, or as Microsoft Azure websites. 

On the client side, Application Insights can take telemetry from web pages and a wide variety of devices including iOS, Android and Windows Store apps.

## <a name="setup"></a>Set up performance monitoring
If you haven't yet added Application Insights to your project (that is, if it doesn't have ApplicationInsights.config), choose one of these ways to get started:

* [ASP.NET web apps](app-insights-asp-net.md)
  * [Add exception monitoring](app-insights-asp-net-exceptions.md)
  * [Add dependency monitoring](app-insights-monitor-performance-live-website-now.md)
* [J2EE web apps](app-insights-java-get-started.md)
  * [Add dependency monitoring](app-insights-java-agent.md)

## <a name="view"></a>Exploring performance metrics
In [the Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), browse to the Application Insights resource that you set up for your application. The overview blade shows basic performance data:

Click any chart to see more detail, and to see results for a longer period. For example, click the Requests tile and then select a time range:

![Click through to more data and select a time range](./media/app-insights-web-monitor-performance/appinsights-48metrics.png)

Click a chart to choose which metrics it displays, or add a new chart and select its metrics:

![Click a graph to choose metrics](./media/app-insights-web-monitor-performance/appinsights-61perfchoices.png)

> [!NOTE]
> **Uncheck all the metrics** to see the full selection that is available. The metrics fall into groups; when any member of a group is selected, only the other members of that group appear.

## <a name="metrics"></a>What does it all mean? Performance tiles and reports
There's a variety of performance metrics you can get. Let's start with those that appear by default on the application blade.

### Requests
The number of HTTP requests received in a specified period. Compare this with the results on other reports to see how your app behaves as the load varies.

HTTP requests include all GET or POST requests for pages, data and images.

Click on the tile to get counts for specific URLs.

### Average response time
Measures the time between a web request entering your application and the response being returned.

The points show a moving average. If there are a lot of requests, there might be some that deviate from the average without an obvious peak or dip in the graph.

Look for unusual peaks. In general, expect response time to rise with a rise in requests. If the rise is disproportionate, your app might be hitting a resource limit such as CPU or the capacity of a service it uses.

Click on the tile to get times for specific URLs.

### Slowest requests
![](./media/app-insights-web-monitor-performance/appinsights-44slowest.png)

Shows which requests might need performance tuning.

### Failed requests
![](./media/app-insights-web-monitor-performance/appinsights-46failed.png)

A count of requests that threw uncaught exceptions.

Click the tile to see the details of specific failures, and select an individual request to see its detail. 

Only a representative sample of failures is retained for individual inspection.

### Other metrics
To see what other metrics you can display, click a graph, and then deselect all the metrics to see the full available set. Click (i) to see each metric's definition.

![Deselect all metrics to see the whole set](./media/app-insights-web-monitor-performance/appinsights-62allchoices.png)

Selecting any metric will disable the others that can't appear on the same chart.

## System performance counters
Windows provides a wide variety of performance counters, and you can also define your own.

(For applications hosted on Azure, [send Azure Diagnostics to Application Insights](app-insights-azure-diagnostics.md).)

To see a set of common  [performance counters](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/8590/An-Introduction-To-Performance-Counters), open the **Servers** blade. You can also choose counters by editing a chart and selecting a metric from the performance counters section:

![](./media/app-insights-web-monitor-performance/sys-perf.png)

The complete set of metrics available on your system can be determined on Windows systems by using the PowerShell command [`Get-Counter -ListSet *`](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/hh849685.aspx).

If the counters you want aren't in the metrics list, you can add them to the set that the SDK collects. Open ApplicationInsights.config and edit the performance collector directive:

    <Add Type="Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.Extensibility.PerfCounterCollector.PerformanceCollectorModule, Microsoft.AI.PerfCounterCollector">
      <Counters>
        <Add PerformanceCounter="\Objects\Processes"/>
        <Add PerformanceCounter="\Sales(electronics)\# Items Sold" ReportAs="Item sales"/>
      </Counters>
    </Add>

You can capture both standard counters, and those you have implemented yourself. `\Objects\Processes` is available on all Windows systems; `\Sales...` is an example of a custom counter that might be implemented in a web server. 

The format is `\Category(instance)\Counter"` or for categories that don't have instances, just `\Category\Counter`.

`ReportAs` is required for counter names that contain characters other than these: letters, round brackets, forward slahes, hyphens, underscores, spaces and dots.

If you specify an instance, it will be collected as a dimension "CounterInstanceName" of the reported metric.

### Collecting performance counters in code
To collect system performance counters and push them to Application Insights, you can use the snippet below:

    var perfCollectorModule = new PerformanceCollectorModule();
    perfCollectorModule.Counters.Add(new PerformanceCounterCollectionRequest(
      @"\.NET CLR Memory([replace-with-application-process-name])\# GC Handles", "GC Handles")));
    perfCollectorModule.Initialize(TelemetryConfiguration.Active);

Or you can do the same thing with custom metrics you created:

    var perfCollectorModule = new PerformanceCollectorModule();
    perfCollectorModule.Counters.Add(new PerformanceCounterCollectionRequest(
      @"\Sales(electronics)\# Items Sold", "Items sold"));
    perfCollectorModule.Initialize(TelemetryConfiguration.Active);

In addition, if you want 

### Exception counts
*What's the difference between the Exception rate and Exceptions metrics?*

* *Exception rate* is a system performance counter. The CLR counts all the handled and unhandled exceptions that are thrown, and divides the total in a sampling interval by the length of the interval. The Application Insights SDK collects this result and sends it to the portal.
* *Exceptions* is a count of the TrackException reports received by the portal in the sampling interval of the chart. It includes only the handled exceptions where you have written TrackException calls in your code, and doesn't include all [unhandled exceptions](app-insights-asp-net-exceptions.md). 

## Set alerts
To be notified by email of unusual values of any metric, add an alert. You can choose either to send the email to the account administrators, or to specific email addresses.

![](./media/app-insights-web-monitor-performance/appinsights-413setMetricAlert.png)

Set the resource before the other properties. Don't choose the webtest resources if you want to set alerts on performance or usage metrics.

Be careful to note the units in which you're asked to enter the threshold value.

*I don't see the Add Alert button.* - Is this a group account to which you have read-only access? Check with the account administrator.

## <a name="diagnosis"></a>Diagnosing issues
Here are a few tips for finding and diagnosing performance issues:

* Set up [web tests](app-insights-monitor-web-app-availability.md) to be alerted if your web site goes down or responds incorrectly or slowly. 
* Compare the Request count with other metrics to see if failures or slow response are related to load.
* [Insert and search trace statements](app-insights-diagnostic-search.md) in your code to help pinpoint problems.
