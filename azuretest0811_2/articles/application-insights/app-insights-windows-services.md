# Application Insights on Windows background services
*Application Insights is in preview.*

[Visual Studio Application Insights](app-insights-get-started.md) lets you monitor your deployed application for usage and performance.

All Windows applications - including background services and worker roles - can use the Application Insights SDK to send telemetry to Application Insights. You can also add  SDK to a class library project. 

You can choose which standard data collectors you want to use (for example to monitor performance counters or dependency calls), or just use the Core API and write your own telemetry.

First check whether you are working with another type of Windows application:

* Web apps: go to [ASP.NET 4](app-insights-asp-net.md), [ASP.NET 5](app-insights-asp-net-five.md).
* [Azure Cloud Services](app-insights-cloudservices.md)
* Desktop apps: we recommend [HockeyApp](https://hockeyapp.net). With HockeyApp, you can manage distribution, live testing, and user feedback, as well as monitor usage and crash reports. You can also [send telemetry to Application Insights from a desktop app](app-insights-windows-desktop.md). 

## <a name="add"></a> Create an Application Insights resource
1. In the [Azure portal](http://portal.azure.com/), create a new Application Insights resource. For application type, choose ASP.NET app. 
   
   ![Click New, Application Insights](./media/app-insights-windows-services/01-new.png)
2. Take a copy of the Instrumentation Key. Find the key in the Essentials drop-down of the new resource you just created. Close the Application Map or scroll left to the overview blade for the resource.
   
   ![Click Essentials, select the key, and press ctrl+C](./media/app-insights-windows-services/10.png)

## <a name="sdk"></a>Install the SDK in your application
1. In Visual Studio, edit the NuGet packages of your Windows application project.
   
    ![Right-click the project and select Manage Nuget Packages](./media/app-insights-windows-services/03-nuget.png)
2. Install the Application Insights Windows Server package: Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.WindowsServer
   
    ![Search for "Application Insights"](./media/app-insights-windows-services/04-ai-nuget.png)
   
    *Can I use other packages?*
   
    Yes. Choose the Core API (Microsoft.ApplicationInsights) if you only want to use the API to send your own telemetry. The Windows Server package automatically includes the Core API plus a number of other packages such as performance counter collection and dependency monitoring. 
3. Set your InstrumentationKey.
   
   * If you only installed the core API package Microsoft.ApplicationInsights, you must set the key in code, for example in main(): 
     
     `TelemetryConfiguration.Active.InstrumentationKey = "` *your key* `";` 
     
     If you installed one of the other packages, you can either set the key using code, or set it in ApplicationInsights.config:
     
     `<InstrumentationKey>`*your key*`</InstrumentationKey>` 
     
     If you use ApplicationInsights.config, make sure its properties in Solution Explorer are set to **Build Action = Content, Copy to Output Directory = Copy**.

## <a name="telemetry"></a>Insert telemetry calls
Use any of the [Application Insights API](app-insights-api-custom-events-metrics.md) to send telemetry. If you're using the core API, no telemetry is sent automatically. Typically you'd use:

* `TrackPageView(pageName)` on switching forms, pages, or tabs
* `TrackEvent(eventName)` for other user actions
* `TrackMetric(name, value)` in a background task to send regular reports of metrics not attached to specific events.
* `TrackTrace(logEvent)` for [diagnostic logging](app-insights-diagnostic-search.md)
* `TrackException(exception)` in catch clauses
* `Flush()` to make sure all telemetry is sent before closing the app. Use this only if you are just using the core API (Microsoft.ApplicationInsights). The web SDKs implement this behavior automatically. (If your app runs in contexts where the internet is not always available, see also [Persistence Channel](#persistence-channel).)

#### Telemetry initializers
To see counts of users and sessions you can set the values on each `TelemetryClient` instance. Alternatively, you can use a telemetry initializer to perform this addition for all clients:

```C#

    class UserSessionInitializer : ITelemetryInitializer
    {
        public void Initialize(ITelemetry telemetry)
        {
            telemetry.Context.User.Id = Environment.UserName;
            telemetry.Context.Session.Id = Guid.NewGuid().ToString();
        }

    }

    static class Program
    {
        ...
        static void Main()
        {
            TelemetryConfiguration.Active.TelemetryInitializers.Add(
                new UserSessionInitializer());
            ...

```



## <a name="run"></a>Run your project
[Run your application with F5](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/bg161304.aspx) and use it, so as to generate some telemetry. 

In Visual Studio, you'll see a count of the events that have been sent.

![](./media/app-insights-windows-services/appinsights-09eventcount.png)

Events also appear in the diagnostics and output windows.

## <a name="monitor"></a>See monitor data
Return to your application blade in the Azure portal.

The first events will appear in the [Live Metrics Stream](app-insights-metrics-explorer.md#live-metrics-stream).

## Persistence Channel
If your app runs where the internet connection is not always available or slow, consider using the persistence channel instead of the default in-memory channel. 

The default in-memory channel loses any telemetry that has not been sent by the time the app closes. Although you can use `Flush()` to attempt to send any data remaining in the buffer, it will still lose data if there is a no internet connection, or if the app shuts down before transmission is complete.

By contrast, the persistence channel buffers telemetry in a file, before sending it to the portal. `Flush()` ensures that data is stored in the file. If any data is not sent by the time the app closes, it will remain in the file. When the app restarts, the data will be sent then, if there is an internet connection. Data will accumulate in the file for as long as is necessary until a connection is available. 

### To use the persistence channel
1. Import the NuGet package [Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.PersistenceChannel](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.PersistenceChannel/1.2.3).
2. Include this code in your app, in a suitable initialization location:
   
    ```C# 
   
      using Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.Channel;
      using Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.Extensibility;
      ...
   
      // Set up 
      TelemetryConfiguration.Active.InstrumentationKey = "YOUR INSTRUMENTATION KEY";
   
      TelemetryConfiguration.Active.TelemetryChannel = new PersistenceChannel();
   
    ``` 
3. Use `telemetryClient.Flush()` before your app closes, to make sure data is either sent to the portal or saved to the file.
   
    Note that Flush() is synchronous for the persistence channel, but asynchronous for other channels.

The persistence channel is optimized for devices scenarios, where the number of events produced by application is relatively small and the connection is often unreliable. This channel will write events to the disk into reliable storage first and then attempt to send it. 

#### Example
Letâ€™s say you want to monitor unhandled exceptions. You subscribe to the `UnhandledException` event. In the callback, you include a call to Flush to make sure that  the telemetry will be persisted.

```C# 

AppDomain.CurrentDomain.UnhandledException += CurrentDomain_UnhandledException; 

... 

private void CurrentDomain_UnhandledException(object sender, UnhandledExceptionEventArgs e) 
{ 
    ExceptionTelemetry excTelemetry = new ExceptionTelemetry((Exception)e.ExceptionObject); 
    excTelemetry.SeverityLevel = SeverityLevel.Critical; 
    excTelemetry.HandledAt = ExceptionHandledAt.Unhandled; 

    telemetryClient.TrackException(excTelemetry); 

    telemetryClient.Flush(); 
} 

``` 

When the app shuts down, you'll see a file in `%LocalAppData%\Microsoft\ApplicationInsights\`, which contains the compressed events. 

Next time you start this application, the channel will pick up this file and deliver telemetry to the Application Insights if it can.

#### Test example
```C#

using Microsoft.ApplicationInsights;
using Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.Channel;
using Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.Extensibility;

namespace ConsoleApplication1
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            // Send data from the last time the app ran
            System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(5 * 1000);

            // Set up persistence channel

            TelemetryConfiguration.Active.InstrumentationKey = "YOUR KEY";
            TelemetryConfiguration.Active.TelemetryChannel = new PersistenceChannel();

            // Send some data

            var telemetry = new TelemetryClient();

            for (var i = 0; i < 100; i++)
            {
                var e1 = new Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.DataContracts.EventTelemetry("persistenceTest");
                e1.Properties["i"] = "" + i;
                telemetry.TrackEvent(e1);
            }

            // Make sure it's persisted before we close
            telemetry.Flush();
        }
    }
}

```


The code of the persistence channel is on [github](https://github.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-dotnet/tree/v1.2.3/src/TelemetryChannels/PersistenceChannel).
