# Configure Azure Marketplace image settings in a lab
## Overview
DevTest Labs supports creating new VMs based on Azure Marketplace images depending
on how you have configured Azure Marketplace images to be used in your lab. This article
will show you how to specify which, if any, Azure Marketplace images can be used when
creating new VMs in a lab.

## Select which Azure Marketplace images are allowed when creating a VM
1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=525040).
2. Select **Browse**, and then select **DevTest Labs** from the list.
3. From the list of labs, select the desired lab. 
4. The selected lab's **Settings** blade will be displayed. 
5. On the **Settings** blade, select **Marketplace images**

6. Specify whether you want all the qualified Azure Marketplace images to be available for use as a base of a new VM. If you select **Yes**, 
   then all the Azure Marketplace images that meet all of the following criteria are allowed in the lab:
   
   * The image creates a single VM, **and**
   * The image uses Azure Resource Manager to provision VMs, **and**
   * The image doesn't require purchasing an extra licensing plan
     
     If you want no images to be allowed, or you want to specify which images can be used, select **No**.

7. If you select **No** to the previous step, the **Allowed images/Select all** checkbox will be enabled. 
   You can use this option together with the search box to quickly select or deselect all the items displayed in the list.
   You can also select the Azure Marketplace images you want to allow for VM creation individually by checking each image's corresponding checkbox.
   Select nothing from the list if you don't want to allow any Azure Marketplace images to be used in the lab.

## Next steps
Once you have configured how Azure Marketplace images are allowed when creating a VM, the next step is to [add a VM to your lab](devtest-lab-add-vm-with-artifacts.md).
