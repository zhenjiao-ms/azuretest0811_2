# Continuous delivery to Azure using Visual Studio Team Services and Git
You can use Visual Studio Team Services team projects to host a Git repository for your source code, and automatically build and deploy to Azure web apps or cloud services whenever you push a commit to the repository.

You'll need Visual Studio 2013 and the Azure SDK installed. If you don't already have Visual Studio 2013, download it by choosing the **Get started for free** link at [www.visualstudio.com](http://www.visualstudio.com). Install the Azure SDK from [here](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=239540).

> [!NOTE]
> You need an Visual Studio Team Services account to complete this tutorial:
> You can [open a Visual Studio Team Services account for free](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=512979).
> 
> 

To set up a cloud service to automatically build and deploy to Azure by using Visual Studio Team Services, follow these steps.

## 1: Create a Git repository
1. If you donâ€™t already have a Visual Studio Team Services account, you can get one  [here](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=397665). When you create your team project, choose Git as your source control system. Follow the instructions to connect Visual Studio to your team project.
2. In **Team Explorer**, choose the **Clone this repository** link.
   
    ![](./media/cloud-services-continuous-delivery-use-vso-git/CloneThisRepository.PNG)
3. Specify the location of the local copy and then choose the **Clone** button.

## 2: Create a project and commit it to the repository
1. In **Team Explorer**, in the **Solutions** section, choose the **New** link to create a new project in the local repository.
   
    ![](./media/cloud-services-continuous-delivery-use-vso-git/CreateNewSolutionInClonedRepo.PNG)
2. You can deploy a web app or a cloud service (Azure Application) by following the steps in this walkthrough. Create a new Azure Cloud Service project,
   or a new ASP.NET MVC project. Make sure that the project targets the .NET Framework 4 or later. If you are creating a cloud service project, add an ASP.NET MVC web role and a worker role.
   If you want to create a web app, choose the **ASP.NET Web Application** project template, and then choose **MVC**. See [Create an ASP.NET web app in Azure App Service](../app-service-web/web-sites-dotnet-get-started.md) for more information.
3. Open the shortcut menu for the solution, and choose **Commit**.
   
    ![](./media/cloud-services-continuous-delivery-use-vso-git/CommitMenuItem.PNG)
4. If this is the first time you've used Git in Visual Studio Team Services, you'll need to provide some information to identify yourself in Git. In the **Pending Changes** area of **Team Explorer**, enter your username and email address. Enter a comment for the commit and then choose the **Commit** button.
   
    ![](./media/cloud-services-continuous-delivery-use-vso-git/CommitAChange2.PNG)
5. Note the options to include or exclude specific changes when you check in. If the changes you want are excluded, choose **Include All**.
6. You've now committed the changes in your local copy of the repository. Next, sync those changes with the server by choosing the **Sync** link.

## 3: Connect the project to Azure
1. Now that you have a Git repository in Visual Studio Team Services with some source code in it, you are ready to connect your git repository to Azure.  In the [Azure classic portal](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=213885), select your cloud service or web app, or create a new one by choosing the + icon at the bottom left and choosing **Cloud Service** or **Web App** and then **Quick Create**.
   
    ![](./media/cloud-services-continuous-delivery-use-vso-git/CreateCloudService.PNG)
2. For cloud services, choose the **Set up publishing with Visual Studio Team Services** link. For web apps, choose the **Set up deployment from source control** link.
   
    ![](./media/cloud-services-continuous-delivery-use-vso-git/SetUpPublishingWithVSO.PNG)
3. In the wizard, type the name of your Visual Studio Team Services account in the textbox and choose the **Authorize Now** link. You might be asked to sign in.
   
    ![](./media/cloud-services-continuous-delivery-use-vso-git/AuthorizeConnection.PNG)
4. In the **Connection Request** pop-up dialog, choose **Accept** to authorize Azure to configure your team project in Visual Studio Team Services.
   
    ![](./media/cloud-services-continuous-delivery-use-vso-git/ConnectionRequest.PNG)
5. After authorization succeeds, you see a dropdown list that contains your Visual Studio Team Services team projects.  Select the name of team project that you created in the previous steps, and choose the wizard's checkmark button.
   
    ![](./media/cloud-services-continuous-delivery-use-vso-git/ChooseARepo3.PNG)
   
    The next time you push a commit to your repository, Visual Studio Team Services will build and deploy your project to Azure.

## 4: Trigger a rebuild and redeploy your project
1. In Visual Studio, open up a file and change it. For example, change the file `_Layout.cshtml` under the Views\\Shared folder in an MVC web role.
   
    ![](./media/cloud-services-continuous-delivery-use-vso-git/tfs17.png)
2. Edit the footer text for the site and save the file.
   
    ![](./media/cloud-services-continuous-delivery-use-vso-git/MakeACodeChange.PNG)
3. In **Solution Explorer**, open the shortcut menu for the solution node, project node, or the file you changed, and then choose **Commit**.
4. Type in a comment and choose **Commit**.
   
    ![](./media/cloud-services-continuous-delivery-use-vso-git/CommitAChange2.PNG)
5. Choose the **Sync** link.
   
    ![](./media/cloud-services-continuous-delivery-use-vso-git/SyncChanges2.PNG)
6. Choose the **Push** link to push your commit to the repository in Visual Studio Team Services. (You can also use the **Sync** button to copy your commits to the repository. The difference is that **Sync** also pulls the latest changes from the repository.)
   
    ![](./media/cloud-services-continuous-delivery-use-vso-git/PushCurrentBranch.PNG)
7. Choose the **Home** button to return to the **Team Explorer** home page.
   
    ![](./media/cloud-services-continuous-delivery-use-vso-git/TeamExplorerHome.png)
8. Choose **Builds** to view the builds in progress.
   
    ![](./media/cloud-services-continuous-delivery-use-vso-git/TeamExplorerBuilds.PNG)
   
    **Team Explorer** shows that a build has been triggered for your check-in.
   
    ![](./media/cloud-services-continuous-delivery-use-vso-git/BuildInQueue.png)
9. To view a detailed log as the build progresses, double-click the name of the build in progress.
10. While the build is in-progress, take a look at the build definition that was created when you used the wizard to link to Azure.  Open the shortcut menu for the build definition and choose **Edit Build Definition**.
    
    ![](./media/cloud-services-continuous-delivery-use-vso-git/tfs25.png)
11. In the **Trigger** tab, you will see that the build definition is set to build on every check-in, by default. (For a cloud service, Visual Studio Team Services builds and deploys the master branch to the staging environment automatically. You still have to do a manual step to deploy to the live site. For a web app that doesn't have staging environment, it deploys the master branch directly to the live site.
    
    ![](./media/cloud-services-continuous-delivery-use-vso-git/tfs26.png)
12. In the **Process** tab, you can see the deployment environment is set to the name of your cloud service or web app.
    
     ![](./media/cloud-services-continuous-delivery-use-vso-git/ProcessTab.PNG)
13. Specify values for the properties if you want different values than the defaults. The properties for Azure publishing are in the **Deployment** section, and you might also need to set MSBuild parameters. For example, in a cloud service project, to specify a service configuration other than "Cloud", set the MSbuild parameters to `/p:TargetProfile=[YourProfile]` where *[YourProfile]* matches a service configuration file with a name like ServiceConfiguration.*YourProfile*.cscfg.
    
     The following table shows the available properties in the **Deployment** section:
    
    | Property | Default Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | Allow Untrusted Certificates |If false, SSL certificates must be signed by a root authority. |
    | Allow Upgrade |Allows the deployment to update an existing deployment instead of creating a new one. Preserves the IP address. |
    | Do Not Delete |If true, do not overwrite an existing unrelated deployment (upgrade is allowed). |
    | Path to Deployment Settings |The path to your .pubxml file for a web app, relative to the root folder of the repo. Ignored for cloud services. |
    | Sharepoint Deployment Environment |The same as the service name. |
    | Azure Deployment Environment |The web app or cloud service name. |
14. By this time, your build should be completed successfully.
    
     ![](./media/cloud-services-continuous-delivery-use-vso-git/tfs28.png)
15. If you double-click the build name, Visual Studio shows a **Build Summary**, including any test results from associated unit test projects.
    
     ![](./media/cloud-services-continuous-delivery-use-vso-git/tfs29.png)
16. In the [Azure classic portal](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=213885), you can view the associated deployment on the **Deployments** tab when the staging environment is selected.
    
     ![](./media/cloud-services-continuous-delivery-use-vso-git/tfs30.png)
17. Browse to your site's URL. For a web app, just choose  the **Browse** button in the portal. For a cloud service, choose the URL in the **Quick Glance** section of the **Dashboard** page that shows the Staging environment.
    
    Deployments from continuous integration for cloud services are published to the Staging environment by default. You can change this by setting the **Alternate Cloud Service Environment** property to **Production**. Here's where the site URL is on the cloud service's dashboard page.
    
    ![](./media/cloud-services-continuous-delivery-use-vso-git/tfs31.png)
    
    A new browser tab will open to reveal your running site.
    
    ![](./media/cloud-services-continuous-delivery-use-vso-git/tfs32.png)
18. If you make other changes to your project, you trigger more builds, and you will accumulate multiple deployments. The latest one is marked as Active.
    
    ![](./media/cloud-services-continuous-delivery-use-vso-git/tfs33.png)

## 5: Redeploy an earlier build
This step is optional. In the Azure classic portal, choose an earlier deployment and choose **Redeploy** to rewind your site to an earlier check-in. Note that this will trigger a new build in TFS and create a new entry in your deployment history.

![](./media/cloud-services-continuous-delivery-use-vso-git/tfs34.png)

## 6: Change the Production deployment
When you are ready, you can promote the Staging environment to the Production environment by choosing **Swap** in the Azure classic portal. The newly deployed Staging environment is promoted to Production, and the previous Production environment, if any, becomes a Staging environment. The Active deployment may be different for the Production and Staging environments, but the deployment history of recent builds is the same regardless of environment.

![](./media/cloud-services-continuous-delivery-use-vso-git/tfs35.png)

## 7: Deploy from a working branch.
When you use Git, you usually make changes in a working branch and integrate into the master branch when your development reaches a finished state. During the development phase of a project, you'll want to build and deploy the working branch to Azure.

1. In **Team Explorer**, choose the **Home** button and then choose the **Branches** button.
   
    ![](./media/cloud-services-continuous-delivery-use-vso-git/BranchesInTeamExplorer.PNG)
2. Choose the **New Branch** link.
   
    ![](./media/cloud-services-continuous-delivery-use-vso-git/NewBranch.PNG)
3. Enter the name of the branch, such as "working," and choose **Create Branch**. This creates a new local branch.
   
    ![](./media/cloud-services-continuous-delivery-use-vso-git/CreateBranch.PNG)
4. Publish the branch. Choose the branch name in **Unpublished branches**, and choose **Publish**.
   
    ![](./media/cloud-services-continuous-delivery-use-vso-git/PublishBranch.PNG)
5. By default, only changes to the master branch trigger a continuous build. To set up continuous build for a working branch, choose the **Builds** page in **Team Explorer**, and choose **Edit Build Definition**.
6. Open the **Source Settings** tab. Under **Monitored branches for continuous integration and build**, choose **Click here to add a new row**.
   
    ![](./media/cloud-services-continuous-delivery-use-vso-git/SourceSettingsPage.PNG)
7. Specify the branch you created, such as refs/heads/working.
   
    ![](./media/cloud-services-continuous-delivery-use-vso-git/IncludeWorkingBranch.PNG)
8. Make a change in the code, open the shortcut menu for the changed file, and then choose **Commit**.
   
    ![](./media/cloud-services-continuous-delivery-use-vso-git/CommitAChange2.PNG)
9. Choose the **Unsynced Commits** link, and choose  the **Sync** button or the **Push** link to copy the changes to the copy of the working branch in Visual Studio Team Services.
   
   ![](./media/cloud-services-continuous-delivery-use-vso-git/SyncChanges2.PNG)
10. Navigate to the **Builds** view and find the build that just got triggered for the working branch.
