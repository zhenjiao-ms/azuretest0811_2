# Staging an Application in Azure
A packaged application can be deployed to the staging environment in
Azure to be tested before you move it to the production
environment in which the application is accessible on the Internet. The
staging environment is exactly like the production environment, except
that you can only access the staged application with an obfuscated URL
that is generated by Azure. After you have verified that your
application is working correctly, it can be deployed to the production
environment by performing a Virtual IP (VIP) swap.

## Step 1: Stage an Application
This task covers how to stage an application by using the **Microsoft
Azure PowerShell**.

1. When publishing a service, simply pass the **-Slot** parameter to
   the **Publish-AzureServiceProject** cmdlet.
   
   ```powershell
   Publish-AzureServiceProject -Slot staging
   ```
2. Log on to the [Azure classic portal](http://manage.windowsazure.com) and select **Cloud Services**. After the cloud service is created and the **Staging** column status has been updated to **Running**, click on the service name.

3. Select the **Dashboard**, and then select **Staging**.
   
   ![cloud service dashboard](./media/cloud-services-nodejs-stage-application/cloud-service-dashboard-staging.png)
4. Note the value in the **Site URL** entry to the right. The DNS name is an obfuscated internal ID that Azure generated.
   
    ![site url](./media/cloud-services-nodejs-stage-application/cloud-service-staging-url.png)

Now you can verify that the application is working correctly in the staging environment by using the staging site URL.

## Step 2: Upgrade an Application in Production by Swapping VIPs
After you have verified the upgraded version of an application in the
staging environment, you can quickly make it available in production by
swapping the virtual IPs (VIPs) of the staging and production
environments.

> This step assumes that you have already deployed an
> application to production and staged the upgraded version of the
> application.

1. Log into the [Azure classic portal](http://manage.windowsazure.com), click **Cloud Services** and then select the service name.
2. From the **Dashboard**, select **Staging**, and then click **Swap** at the bottom of the page. This opens the VIP Swap dialog.
   
   ![vip swap dialog](./media/cloud-services-nodejs-stage-application/vip-swap-dialog.png)
3. Review the information, and then click **OK**. The two deployments begin updating as the staging deployment switches to production and the production deployment switches to staging.

You have successfully staged a deployment and upgraded a production
deployment by swapping VIPs with the deployment in staging.
