## Overview of Azure Resource Manager templates
Azure Resource Manager templates allow you to declaratively specify the Azure IaaS infrastructure in Json language by defining the dependencies between resources. For a detailed overview of Azure Resource Manager Templates, please refer to the article below:

## Sample template snippet for VM extensions
Deploying VM extensions as part of an Azure Resource Manager template requires you to declaratively specify the extension configuration in the template.
Here is the format for specifying the extension configuration.

      "name": "MyExtension",
      "apiVersion": "2015-05-01-preview",
      "location": "[parameters('location')]",
      "dependsOn": ["[concat('Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/',parameters('vmName'))]"],
      "properties":
      {
      "publisher": "Publisher Namespace",
      "type": "extension Name",
      "typeHandlerVersion": "extension version",
      "settings": {
      // Extension specific configuration goes in here.
      }
      }
      }
