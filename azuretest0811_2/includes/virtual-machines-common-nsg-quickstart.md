You open a port, or create an endpoint, in Azure by creating a network filter that allows traffic to your chosen port on a subnet or virtual machine (VM) network interface. These filters, which control both inbound and outbound traffic, are placed in a Network Security Group and attached to the resource that will receive the traffic.

Let's use a common example of web traffic on port 80. Once you have a VM that is configured to serve web requests on the standard TCP port 80 (remember to start the appropriate services and open any OS firewall rules on the VM as well), you will:

1. Create a Network Security Group.
2. Create an inbound rule allowing traffic with:
   * the destination port range of "80"
   * the source port range of "*" (allowing any source port)
   * a priority value of less 65,500 (to be higher in priority than the default catch-all deny inbound rule)
3. Associate the Network Security Group with the VM network interface or subnet.

You can create very complex network configurations to secure your environment using Network Security Groups and rules, rather than only one or two rules that allow HTTP traffic or remote management.
