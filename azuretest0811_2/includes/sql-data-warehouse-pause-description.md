To save costs, you can pause and resume compute resources on-demand. For example, if you won't be using the database during the night and on weekends, you can pause it during those times, and resume it during the day. You won't be charged for DWUs while the database is paused.

When you pause a database:

* Compute and memory resources are returned to the pool of available resources in the data center
* DWU costs are zero for the duration of the pause.
* Data storage is not affected and your data stays intact. 
* SQL Data Warehouse cancels all running or queued operations.
