## Prerequisite: Install the Azure CLI
To perform the steps in this article, you'll need to [install the Azure Command-Line Interface for Mac, Linux, and Windows (Azure CLI)](../articles/xplat-cli-install.md) and you'll need to [log on to Azure](../articles/xplat-cli-connect.md). 

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't have an Azure account, you'll need one. Go sign up for a [free trial here](../articles/active-directory/sign-up-organization.md). In addition, to follow along completely you'll need to have either [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) or some other JSON parsing tool or library installed.
