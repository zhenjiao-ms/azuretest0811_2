## Virtual Network
Virtual Networks (VNET) and subnets resources help define a security boundary for workloads running in Azure. A VNet is characterized by a collection of address spaces, defined as CIDR blocks. 

> [!NOTE]
> Network administrators are familiar with CIDR notation. If you are not familiar with CIDR, [learn more about it](http://whatismyipaddress.com/cidr).

VNets contain the following properties.

| Property | Description | Sample values |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **addressSpace** |Collection of address prefixes that make up the VNet in CIDR notation |192.168.0.0/16 |
| **subnets** |Collection of subnets that make up the VNet |see [subnets](#Subnets) below. |
| **ipAddress** |IP address assigned to object. This is a read-only property. |104.42.233.77 |

### Subnets
A subnet is a child resource of a VNet, and helps define segments of address spaces within a CIDR block, using IP address prefixes. NICs can be added to subnets, and connected to VMs, providing connectivity for various workloads.

Subnets contain the following properties. 

| Property | Description | Sample values |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **addressPrefix** |Single address prefix that make up the subnet in CIDR notation |192.168.1.0/24 |
| **networkSecurityGroup** |NSG applied to the subnet |see [NSGs](#Network-Security-Group) |
| **routeTable** |Route table applied to the subnet |see [UDR](#Route-table) |
| **ipConfigurations** |Collection of IP configruation objects used by NICs connected to the subnet |see [UDR](#Route-table) |
