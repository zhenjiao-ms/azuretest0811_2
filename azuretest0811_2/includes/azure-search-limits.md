<sup>1</sup> Storage size is either a fixed amount or the number of documents per service, whichever comes first.

<sup>2</sup> QPS is an approximation based on heuristics, using simulated and actual customer workloads to derive estimated values. Exact QPS throughput will vary depending on your data and the nature of the query.

<sup>3</sup> Search units are the billable unit for either a replica or a partition. You need both for storage, indexing, and query operations. See [Capacity Planning](../articles/search/search-capacity-planning.md) for valid combinations of replicas and partitions that keep you within the maximum limit of 3 or 36 units, for Basic and Standard respectively.

<sup>4</sup> Price is for the U.S. market, illustrating relative costs among alternative tiers. Different markets have different prices. Refer to the [Pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/search/) for rates in other currencies. The rate is per search unit (SU). At the S1 level, a configuration of 3 search units (say 3 replicas and 1 partition) would cost $750 per month on average. If you scale down to fewer SU within the month, the bill is prorated so that you are charged only for what you use.

<sup>5</sup> Basic tier is the only tier with a lower limit of 100 fields per index.

<sup>6</sup> [Basic tier](http://aka.ms/azuresearchbasic) is available at an introductory rate of 50% off the full price during the preview period.

<sup>7</sup> S2 requires a service ticket. It cannot be provisioned in the portal. Please contact Support or send email to azuresearch_contact@microsoft.com for assistance.

<sup>8</sup> You can raise the maximum number of services per subscription for all tiers except Free. Please contact Support or send email to azuresearch_contact@microsoft.com for assistance.
