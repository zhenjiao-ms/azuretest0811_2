Your IaaS virtual machines (VMs) and PaaS role instances in a virtual network automatically receive a private IP address from a range that you specify, based on the subnet they are connected to. That address is retained by the VMs and role instances, until they are decommissioned. You decommission a VM or role instance by stopping it from PowerShell, the Azure CLI, or the Azure portal. In those cases, once the VM or role instance starts again, it will receive an available IP address from the Azure infrastructure, which might not be the same it previously had. If you shut down the VM or role instance from the guest operating system, it retains the IP address it had.  

In certain cases, you want a VM or role instance to have a static IP address, for example, if your VM is going to run DNS or will be a domain controller. You can do so by setting a static private IP address.
