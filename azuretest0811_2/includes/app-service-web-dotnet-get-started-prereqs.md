* The tutorial assumes you have worked with ASP.NET MVC. If you need an introduction, see [Getting Started with ASP.NET MVC 5](http://www.asp.net/mvc/overview/getting-started/introduction/getting-started).
* You need an Azure account. You can [open a free Azure account](/pricing/free-trial/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) or [Activate Visual Studio subscriber benefits](/pricing/member-offers/msdn-benefits-details/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F). If you want to get started with Azure App Service before you sign up for an Azure account, go to [Try App Service](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=523751). There, you can immediately create a short-lived starter  app in App Service â€” no credit card required, and no commitments.
