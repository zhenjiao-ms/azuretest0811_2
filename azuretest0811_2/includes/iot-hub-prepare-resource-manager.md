## Prepare to authenticate Resource Manager requests
You must authenticate all the operations that you perform on resources using the [Azure Resource Manager](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn790557.aspx) with Azure Active Directory (AD). The easiest way to configure this is to use PowerShell or Azure CLI.

You should install [Azure PowerShell 1.0](../articles/powershell-install-configure.md) or later before you continue.

The following steps show how to set up password authentication for an AD application using PowerShell. You can run these commands in a standard PowerShell session.

1. Log in to your Azure subscription using the following command:
   
    ```
    Login-AzureRmAccount
    ```
2. Make a note of your **TenantId** and **SubscriptionId**. You will need them later.
3. Create a new Azure Active Directory application using the following command, replacing the place holders:
   
   * **{Display name}:** a display name for your application such as **MySampleApp**
   * **{Home page URL}:** the URL of the home page of your app such as **http://mysampleapp/home**. This URL does not need to point to a real application.
   * **{Application identifier}:** A unique identifier such as **http://mysampleapp**. This URL does not need to point to a real application.
   * **{Password}:** A password that you will use to authenticate with your app.
     
     ```
     New-AzureRmADApplication -DisplayName {Display name} -HomePage {Home page URL} -IdentifierUris {Application identifier} -Password {Password}
     ```
4. Make a note of the **ApplicationId** of the application you created. You will need this later.
5. Create a new service principal using the following command, replacing **{MyApplicationId}** with the **ApplicationId** from the previous step:
   
    ```
    New-AzureRmADServicePrincipal -ApplicationId {MyApplicationId}
    ```
6. Setup a role assignment using the following command, replacing **{MyApplicationId}** with your **ApplicationId**.
   
    ```
    New-AzureRmRoleAssignment -RoleDefinitionName Owner -ServicePrincipalName {MyApplicationId}
    ```

You have now finished creating the Azure AD application that will enable you to authenticate from your custom C# application. You will need the following values later in this tutorial:

* TenantId
* SubscriptionId
* ApplicationId
* Password
