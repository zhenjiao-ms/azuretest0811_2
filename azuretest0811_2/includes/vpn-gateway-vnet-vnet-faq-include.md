* The virtual networks can be in the same or different Azure regions (locations).
* A cloud service or a load balancing endpoint CANNOT span across virtual networks, even if they are connected together.
* Connecting multiple Azure virtual networks together doesn't require any on-premises VPN gateways unless cross-premises connectivity is required.
* VNet-to-VNet supports connecting virtual networks. It does not support connecting virtual machines or cloud services NOT in a virtual network.
* VNet-to-VNet requires Azure VPN gateways with RouteBased (previously called Dynamic Routing) VPN types. 
* Virtual network connectivity can be used simultaneously with multi-site VPNs, with a maximum of 10 (Default/Standard Gateways) or 30 (High Performance Gateways) VPN tunnels for a virtual network VPN gateway connecting to either other virtual networks or on-premises sites.
* The address spaces of the virtual networks and on-premises local network sites must not overlap. Overlapping address spaces will cause the creation of VNet-to-VNet connections to fail.
* Redundant tunnels between a pair of virtual networks are not supported.
* All VPN tunnels of the virtual network share the available bandwidth on the Azure VPN gateway and the same VPN gateway uptime SLA in Azure.
* VNet-to-VNet traffic travels across the Microsoft Network, not the Internet.
* VNet-to-VNet traffic within the same region is free for both directions; cross region VNet-to-VNet egress traffic is charged with the outbound inter-VNet data transfer rates based on the source regions.
