## Public IP address
A public IP address resource provides either a reserved or dynamic Internet facing IP address. Although you can create a public IP address as a stand alone object, you need to associate it to another object to actually use the address. You can associate a public IP address to a load balancer, application  gateway, or a NIC to provide Internet access to those resources.  

| Property | Description | Sample values |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **publicIPAllocationMethod** |Defines if the IP address is *static* or *dynamic*. |static, dynamic |
| **idleTimeoutInMinutes** |Defines the idle time out, with a default value of 4 minutes. If no more packets for a given session is received within this time, the session is terminated. |any value between 4 and 30 |
| **ipAddress** |IP address assigned to object. This is a read-only property. |104.42.233.77 |

### DNS settings
Public IP addresses have a child object named **dnsSettings** containing the following properties:

| Property | Description | Sample values |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **domainNameLabel** |Host named used for name resolution. |www, ftp, vm1 |
| **fqdn** |Fully qualified name for the public IP. |www.westus.cloudapp.azure.com |
| **reverseFqdn** |Fully qualified domain name that resolves to the IP address and is registered in DNS as a PTR record. |www.contoso.com. |

Sample public IP address in JSON format:
