1. In the MainPage.xaml.cs project file, add the following **using** statements:
   
        using System.Linq;        
        using Windows.Security.Credentials;
2. Replace the **AuthenticateAsync** method with the following code:
   
        private async System.Threading.Tasks.Task<bool> AuthenticateAsync()
        {
            string message;
            bool success = false;
   
            // This sample uses the Facebook provider.
            var provider = MobileServiceAuthenticationProvider.Facebook;
   
            // Use the PasswordVault to securely store and access credentials.
            PasswordVault vault = new PasswordVault();
            PasswordCredential credential = null;
   
            try
            {
                // Try to get an existing credential from the vault.
                credential = vault.FindAllByResource(provider.ToString()).FirstOrDefault();
            }
            catch (Exception)
            {
                // When there is no matching resource an error occurs, which we ignore.
            }
   
            if (credential != null)
            {
                // Create a user from the stored credentials.
                user = new MobileServiceUser(credential.UserName);
                credential.RetrievePassword();
                user.MobileServiceAuthenticationToken = credential.Password;
   
                // Set the user from the stored credentials.
                App.MobileService.CurrentUser = user;
   
                // Consider adding a check to determine if the token is 
                // expired, as shown in this post: http://aka.ms/jww5vp.
   
                success = true;
                message = string.Format("Cached credentials for user - {0}", user.UserId);
            }
            else
            {
                try
                {
                    // Login with the identity provider.
                    user = await App.MobileService
                        .LoginAsync(provider);
   
                    // Create and store the user credentials.
                    credential = new PasswordCredential(provider.ToString(),
                        user.UserId, user.MobileServiceAuthenticationToken);
                    vault.Add(credential);
   
                    success = true;
                    message = string.Format("You are now logged in - {0}", user.UserId);
                }
                catch (MobileServiceInvalidOperationException)
                {
                    message = "You must log in. Login Required";
                }
            }
   
            var dialog = new MessageDialog(message);
            dialog.Commands.Add(new UICommand("OK"));
            await dialog.ShowAsync();
   
            return success;
        }
   
    In this version of **AuthenticateAsync**, the app tries to use credentials stored in the **PasswordVault** to access the service. A regular sign-in is also performed when there is no stored credential.

   > A cached token may be expired, and token expiration can also occur after authentication when the app is in use. To learn how to determine if a token is expired, see [Check for expired authentication tokens](http://aka.ms/jww5vp). For a solution to handling authorization errors related to expiring tokens, see the post [Caching and handling expired tokens in Azure Mobile Services managed SDK](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/carlosfigueira/archive/2014/03/13/caching-and-handling-expired-tokens-in-azure-mobile-services-managed-sdk.aspx).

3. Restart the app twice.
   
    Notice that on the first start-up, sign-in with the provider is again required. However, on the second restart the cached credentials are used and sign-in is bypassed.
