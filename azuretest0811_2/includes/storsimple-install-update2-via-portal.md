#### To install an update from the Azure portal
1. On the StorSimple service page, select your device. Navigate to **Devices** > **Maintenance**.
2. At the bottom of the page, click **Scan Updates**. A job will be created to scan for available updates. You will be notified when the job has completed successfully.
3. In the **Software Updates** section on the same page, you will see that new software updates are available. We recommend that you review the release notes before you apply an update on your device.
4. At the bottom of the page, click **Install Updates**, and then **OK**.
5. In the **Install updates** dialog box, make sure that you've followed the recommendations, then select **I understand the above requirement and am ready to upgrade my device** and click the check button.

6. A set of prerequisite checks will now start. These include:
   
   * **Controller health checks** to verify that both the device controllers are healthy and online.
   * **Hardware component health checks** to verify that all the hardware components on your StorSimple device are healthy.
   * **DATA 0 checks** to verify that DATA 0 is enabled on your device. If this interface is not enabled, you will need to enable it and then retry.
   * **DATA 2 and DATA 3 checks** to verify that DATA 2 and DATA 3 network interfaces are not enabled. If these interfaces are enabled, then you will need to disable them and then try to update your device. This check is performed only if you are updating from a device running GA software. Devices running versions 0.1, 0.2, or 0.3 will not need this check.
   * **Gateway check** on any device running a version prior to Update 1. This check is performed on all the device running pre-update 1 software but fails on the devices that have a gateway configured for a network interface other than DATA 0.
     
     The update is applied if all checks are successfully completed. You will be notified that checks are in progress.

     The following is an example in which the checks failed. You will need to verify that both the device controllers are healthy and online. You will also need to check the health of the hardware components. In this example, Controller 0 and Controller 1 components need attention. You may need to contact Microsoft Support if you cannot address these issues by yourself.

7. After the checks are successfully completed, an update job will be created. You will be notified when the update job is successfully created.

    The update will then be applied on your device.
8. To monitor the progress of the update job, click **View Job**. On the **Jobs** page, you can see the update progress.
9. The update will take a few hours to complete. Select the update job and click **Details** to view the details of the job at any time.
10. After the job is complete, navigate to the **Maintenance** page and scroll down to **Software Updates**.
