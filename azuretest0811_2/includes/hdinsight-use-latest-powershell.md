> Azure PowerShell support for managing HDInsight resources using Azure Service Manager (ASM) is **deprecated**, and will be removed by January 1, 2017. The steps in this document use the new HDInsight cmdlets that work with Azure Resource Manager (ARM).
> 
> Please follow the steps in [Install and configure Azure PowerShell](../articles/powershell-install-configure.md) to install the latest version of Azure PowerShell. If you have scripts that need to be modified to use the new cmdlets that work with Azure Resource Manager, see [Migrating to Azure Resource Manager-based development tools for HDInsight clusters](../articles/hdinsight/hdinsight-hadoop-development-using-azure-resource-manager.md) for more information.
