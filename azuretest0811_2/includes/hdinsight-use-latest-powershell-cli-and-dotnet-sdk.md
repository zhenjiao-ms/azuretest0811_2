> Support for managing HDInsight resources using Azure Service Manager (ASM) through Azure PowerShell, the Azure CLI, and the HDInsight .NET SDK is **deprecated**, and will be removed by January 1, 2017. The steps in this document use the new Azure PowerShell cmdlets, Azure CLI commands, and .NET SDK that work with Azure Resource Manager (ARM).
> 
> Please follow the steps in the [Install and Configure Azure CLI](../articles/xplat-cli-install.md) and [Install and Configure Azure PowerShell](../articles/powershell-install-configure.md) to install the latest version of Azure PowerShell and the Azure CLI. To install the latest version of the HDInsight .NET SDK, use the information provided on the [Microsoft Azure HDInsight .NET SDK](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Management.HDInsight/) NuGet page. If you have existing scripts or applications that need to be modified to use the new cmdlets, new CLI commands, or .NET SDK, see [Migrating to Azure Resource Manager-based development tools for HDInsight clusters](../articles/hdinsight/hdinsight-hadoop-development-using-azure-resource-manager.md) for more information.
