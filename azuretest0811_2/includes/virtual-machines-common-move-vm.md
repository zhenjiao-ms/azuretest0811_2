This article walks you through how to move a VM between subscriptions. This can be handy if you originally created a VM in a personal subscription and now want to move it to your company's subscription to continue your work.

> [!NOTE]
> New resource IDs will be created as part of the move. Once the VM has been moved, you will need to update your tools and scripts to use the new resource IDs.

4. Select each of the resources to move. In most cases, you should move all of the listed optional resources.
5. Select the **Subscription** where you want the VM to be moved.
6. Select an existing **Resource group** or type a name to have a new resource group created.
7. When you are done, select that you understand that new resource IDs will be created and those need to be used with the VM once it is moved, then click **OK**.
