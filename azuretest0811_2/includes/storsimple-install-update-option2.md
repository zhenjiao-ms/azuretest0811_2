#### To install Update 1.2 from the Azure classic portal
1. In the Azure classic portal, go to the **Devices** page and select your device.
2. Navigate to **Devices** > **Configure**.
3. Under **Network Interfaces**, first verify that you have at least one network interface that is iSCSI-enabled. Then locate the network interface (other than DATA 0) that has a gateway assigned.
4. Disable the network interface that has an assigned gateway and save the modified configuration. Note the network interface settings are retained and so when you re-enable this network interface later, the portal will revert to the original settings.
5. You can now [use the Azure classic portal to install Update 1.2](#install-update-12-via-the-azure-classic-portal). Follow the instructions starting from step 3 of this procedure. After you have installed all the updates, you can re-enable the network interface that you disabled.
