## FAQ
### How much do reverse DNS records cost?
They’re free!  There is no additional cost for reverse DNS records or queries.

### Will my reverse DNS records resolve from the internet?

### Will a default reverse DNS record be created for my Cloud Services?

Where the validation for reverse DNS checks fail, the service management operation will fail. Please correct the reverse DNS value as required, and retry.
