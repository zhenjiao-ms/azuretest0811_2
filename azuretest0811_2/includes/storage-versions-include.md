### Storage Service Versions
The Azure Storage services are regularly updated with support for new features. The Azure Storage services REST API reference describes each supported version and its features. We recommend that you use the latest version whenever possible. For information on the latest version of the Azure Storage services, as well as information on previous versions, see [Versioning for the Azure Storage Services](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dd894041.aspx).
