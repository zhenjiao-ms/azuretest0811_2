### To take a backup
1. On the device **Quick Start** page, click **Add a backup policy**. This will start the Add Backup Policy wizard. 
2. On the **Define your backup policy** page:
   
   1. Supply a name that contains between 3 and 150 characters for your backup policy.
   2. Select the volumes to be backed up. If you select more than one volume, these volumes will be grouped together to create a crash-consistent backup.
   3. Click the arrow icon ![arrow-icon](./media/storsimple-take-backup/HCS_ArrowIcon-include.png).

3. On the **Define a schedule** page:
   
   1. Select the type of backup from the drop-down list. For faster restores, select **Local Snapshot**. For data resiliency, select **Cloud Snapshot**.
   2. Specify the backup frequency in minutes, hours, days, or weeks.
   3. Select a retention time. The retention choices depend on the backup frequency. For example, for a daily policy, the retention can be specified in weeks, whereas retention for a monthly policy is in months.
   4. Select the starting time and date for the backup policy.
   5. Select the **Enable** check box to enable the backup policy. 
   6. Click the check icon ![check-icon](./media/storsimple-take-backup/HCS_CheckIcon-include.png) to save the policy.
      
      ![Add-backup-policy](./media/storsimple-take-backup/HCS_AddBackupPolicyWizard2M-include.png)
      
      You now have a backup policy that will create scheduled backups of your volume data.

You have completed the device configuration.
