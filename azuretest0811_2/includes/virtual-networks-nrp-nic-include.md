## NIC
A network interface card (NIC) resource provides network connectivity to an existing subnet in a VNet resource. Although you can create a NIC as a stand alone object, you need to associate it to another object to actually provide connectivity. A NIC can be used to connect a VM to a subnet, a public IP address, or a load balancer.  

| Property | Description | Sample values |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **virtualMachine** |VM the NIC is associated with. |/subscriptions/{guid}/../Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/vm1 |
| **macAddress** |MAC address for the NIC |any value between 4 and 30 |
| **networkSecurityGroup** |NSG associated to the NIC |/subscriptions/{guid}/../Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/myNSG1 |
| **dnsSettings** |DNS settings for the NIC |see [PIP](#Public-IP-address) |

A Network Interface Card, or NIC, represents a network interface that can be associated to a virtual machine (VM). A VM can have one or more NICs.

### IP configurations
NICs have a child object named **ipConfigurations** containing the following properties:

| Property | Description | Sample values |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **subnet** |Subnet the NIC is onnected to. |/subscriptions/{guid}/../Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/myvnet1/subnets/mysub1 |
| **privateIPAddress** |IP address for the NIC in the subnet |10.0.0.8 |
| **privateIPAllocationMethod** |IP allocation method |Dynamic or Static |
| **enableIPForwarding** |Whether the NIC can be used for routing |true or false |
| **primary** |Whether the NIC is the primary NIC for the VM |true or false |
| **publicIPAddress** |PIP associated with the NIC |see [DNS Settings](#DNS-settings) |
| **loadBalancerBackendAddressPools** |Back end address pools the NIC is associated with | |
| **loadBalancerInboundNatRules** |Inbound load balancer NAT rules the NIC is associated with | |
