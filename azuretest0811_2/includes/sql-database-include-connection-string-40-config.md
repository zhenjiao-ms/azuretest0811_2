## Connection string
-->


### Example config file for connection string security
It is unsound to put the connection string as literals in your C# code. It is better to put the connection string in a config file. There you can edit the string any time without the need to recompile.

Let's assume your compiled C# program is named **ConsoleApplication1.exe**, and that this .exe resides in a **bin\debug\** directory.

In this example, most parts of your connection string are stored in a config file named exactly **ConsoleApplication1.exe.config**. This config file must also reside in **bin\debug\**.

In the XML of the following config file you see a connection string named **ConnectionString4NoUserIDNoPassword**. The C# code looks for this string.

You must edit real names in for the placeholders:

* {your_serverName_here}
* {your_databaseName_here}
  
        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
        <configuration>
            <startup> 
                <supportedRuntime version="v4.0" sku=".NETFramework,Version=v4.5" />
            </startup>
  
            <connectionStrings>
                <clear />
                <add name="ConnectionString4NoUserIDNoPassword"
                providerName="System.Data.ProviderName"
  
                connectionString=
                "Server=tcp:{your_serverName_here}.database.windows.net,1433;
                Database={your_databaseName_here};
                Connection Timeout=30;
                Encrypt=True;
                TrustServerCertificate=False;" />
            </connectionStrings>
        </configuration>

For this illustration we chose to omit two parameters:

* User ID={your_userName_here};
* Password={your_password_here};

You can include them, but sometimes it is better to have your program get those values from keyboard input by the user. It depends.
