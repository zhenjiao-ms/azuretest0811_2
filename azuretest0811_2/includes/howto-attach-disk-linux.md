## Attach an empty disk
1. Open Azure CLI and [connect to your Azure subscription](../articles/xplat-cli-connect.md). Make sure you are in Azure Service Management mode (`azure config mode asm`).
2. Enter `azure vm disk attach-new` to create and attach a new disk as shown in the following. Replace *TestVM* with the name of your Linux Virtual Machine and specify the size of the disk in GB, which is 100GB in this example:
   
       azure vm disk attach-new TestVM 100
3. After the data disk is created and attached, it's listed in the output of `azure vm disk list <virtual-machine-name>` as shown in the following:
   
     $ azure vm disk list TestVM
     info:    Executing command vm disk list
   
   * Fetching disk images
   * Getting virtual machines
   * Getting VM disks
     data:    Lun  Size(GB)  Blob-Name                         OS
     data:    ---  --------  --------------------------------  -----
     data:         30        TestVM-2645b8030676c8f8.vhd  Linux
     data:    0    100       TestVM-76f7ee1ef0f6dddc.vhd
     info:    vm disk list command OK

## Attach an existing disk
Attaching an existing disk requires that you have a .vhd available in a storage account.

1. Open Azure CLI and [connect to your Azure subscription](../articles/xplat-cli-connect.md). Make sure you are in Azure Service Management mode (`azure config mode asm`).
2. Check if the VHD you want to attach is already uploaded to your Azure subscription:
   
     $azure vm disk list
     info:    Executing command vm disk list
   
   * Fetching disk images
     data:    Name                                          OS
     data:    --------------------------------------------  -----
     data:    myTestVhd                                     Linux
     data:    TestVM-ubuntuVMasm-0-201508060029150744  Linux
     data:    TestVM-ubuntuVMasm-0-201508060040530369
     info:    vm disk list command OK
3. If you don't find the disk that you want to use, you may upload a local VHD to your subscription by using
   `azure vm disk create` or `azure vm disk upload`. An example of `disk create` would be as in the following:
   
       $azure vm disk create myTestVhd2 .\TempDisk\test.VHD -l "East US" -o Linux
       info:    Executing command vm disk create
       + Retrieving storage accounts
       info:    VHD size : 10 GB
       info:    Uploading 10485760.5 KB
       Requested:100.0% Completed:100.0% Running:   0 Time:   25s Speed:    82 KB/s
       info:    Finishing computing MD5 hash, 16% is complete.
       info:    https://mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/disks/test.VHD was
       uploaded successfully
       info:    vm disk create command OK
   
   You may also use `azure vm disk upload` to upload a VHD to a specific storage account. Read more about the commands to manage your Azure virtual machine data disks [over here](../articles/virtual-machines-command-line-tools.md#commands-to-manage-your-azure-virtual-machine-data-disks).
4. Now you attach the desired VHD to your virtual machine:
   
       $azure vm disk attach TestVM myTestVhd
       info:    Executing command vm disk attach
       + Getting virtual machines
       + Adding Data-Disk
       info:    vm disk attach command OK
   
   Make sure to replace *TestVM* with the name of your virtual machine, and *myTestVhd* with your desired VHD.
5. You can verify the disk is attached to the virtual machine with `azure vm disk list <virtual-machine-name>`:
   
     $azure vm disk list TestVM
     info:    Executing command vm disk list
   
   * Fetching disk images
   * Getting virtual machines
   * Getting VM disks
     data:    Lun  Size(GB)  Blob-Name                         OS
     data:    ---  --------  --------------------------------  -----
     data:         30        TestVM-2645b8030676c8f8.vhd  Linux
     data:    1    10        test.VHD
     data:    0    100        TestVM-76f7ee1ef0f6dddc.vhd
     info:    vm disk list command OK

> [!NOTE]
> After you add a data disk, you'll need to log on to the virtual machine and initialize the disk so the virtual machine can use the disk for storage (see the steps below for more information on how to do this).
