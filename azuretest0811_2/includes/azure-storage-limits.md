<sup>1</sup>This includes both Standard and Premium storage accounts. If you require more than 200 storage accounts, make a request through [Azure Support](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/faq/). The Azure Storage team will review your business case and may approve up to 250 storage accounts. 

<sup>2</sup>*Ingress* refers to all data (requests) being sent to a storage account. *Egress* refers to all data (responses) being received from a storage account.  

<sup>3</sup>Azure Storage replication options include:

* **RA-GRS**: Read-access geo-redundant storage. If RA-GRS is enabled, egress targets for the secondary location are identical to those for the primary location.
* **GRS**:  Geo-redundant storage. 
* **ZRS**: Zone-redundant storage. Available only for block blobs. 
* **LRS**: Locally redundant storage.
