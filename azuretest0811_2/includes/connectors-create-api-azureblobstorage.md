### Prerequisites
* An Azure account; you can create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free)
* An [Azure Blob Storage account](../articles/storage/storage-create-storage-account.md) including the storage account name, and its access key. This information is listed in the properties of the storage account in the Azure portal. Read more about [Azure Storage](../articles/storage/storage-introduction.md).

Before using your Azure Blob Storage account in a logic app, connect to your Azure Blob Storage account. You can do this easily within your logic app on the Azure  portal.  

Connect to your Azure Blob Storage account using the following steps:  

1. Create a logic app. In the Logic Apps designer, add a trigger, and then add an action. Select **Show Microsoft managed APIs** in the drop down list, and then enter "blob" in the search box. Select one of the actions:
