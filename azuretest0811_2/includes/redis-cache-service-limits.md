Azure Redis Cache limits and sizes are different for each pricing tier. To see the pricing tiers and their associated sizes, see [Azure Redis Cache Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cache/).

For more information on Azure Redis Cache configuration limits, see [Default Redis server configuration](../articles/redis-cache/cache-configure.md#default-redis-server-configuration).

Because configuration and management of Azure Redis Cache instances is done by Microsoft, not all Redis commands are supported in Azure Redis Cache. For more information, see [Redis commands not supported in Azure Redis Cache]((redis-cache/cache-configure.md#redis-commands-not-supported-in-azure-redis-cache).
