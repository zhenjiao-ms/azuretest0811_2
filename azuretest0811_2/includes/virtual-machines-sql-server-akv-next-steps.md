## Next steps
After enabling Azure Key Vault Integration, you can enable SQL Server encryption on your SQL VM. First, you will need to create an asymmetric key inside your key vault and a symmetric key within SQL Server on your VM. Then, you will be able to execute T-SQL statements to enable encryption for your databases and backups.

There are several forms of encryption you can take advantage of:

* [Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bb934049.aspx)
* [Encrypted backups](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn449489.aspx)
* [Column Level Encryption (CLE)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms173744.aspx)

The following Transact-SQL scripts provide examples for each of these areas.

> [!NOTE]
> Each example is based on the two prerequisites: an asymmetric key from your key vault called **CONTOSO_KEY** and a credential created by the AKV Integration feature called **Azure_EKM_TDE_cred**.
>

### Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)
1. Create a SQL Server login to be used by the Database Engine for TDE, then add the credential to it.
   
        USE master;
        -- Create a SQL Server login associated with the asymmetric key 
        -- for the Database engine to use when it loads a database 
        -- encrypted by TDE.
        CREATE LOGIN TDE_Login 
        FROM ASYMMETRIC KEY CONTOSO_KEY;
        GO
   
        -- Alter the TDE Login to add the credential for use by the 
        -- Database Engine to access the key vault
        ALTER LOGIN TDE_Login 
        ADD CREDENTIAL Azure_EKM_TDE_cred;
        GO
2. Create the database encryption key that will be used for TDE.
   
        USE ContosoDatabase;
        GO
   
        CREATE DATABASE ENCRYPTION KEY 
        WITH ALGORITHM = AES_128 
        ENCRYPTION BY SERVER ASYMMETRIC KEY CONTOSO_KEY;
        GO
   
        -- Alter the database to enable transparent data encryption.
        ALTER DATABASE ContosoDatabase 
        SET ENCRYPTION ON;
        GO

### Encrypted backups
1. Create a SQL Server login to be used by the Database Engine for encrypting backups, and add the credential to it.
   
        USE master;
        -- Create a SQL Server login associated with the asymmetric key 
        -- for the Database engine to use when it is encrypting the backup.
        CREATE LOGIN Backup_Login 
        FROM ASYMMETRIC KEY CONTOSO_KEY;
        GO 
   
        -- Alter the Encrypted Backup Login to add the credential for use by 
        -- the Database Engine to access the key vault
        ALTER LOGIN Backup_Login 
        ADD CREDENTIAL Azure_EKM_Backup_cred ;
        GO
2. Backup the database specifying encryption with the asymmetric key stored in the key vault.
   
        USE master;
        BACKUP DATABASE [DATABASE_TO_BACKUP]
        TO DISK = N'[PATH TO BACKUP FILE]' 
        WITH FORMAT, INIT, SKIP, NOREWIND, NOUNLOAD, 
        ENCRYPTION(ALGORITHM = AES_256, SERVER ASYMMETRIC KEY = [CONTOSO_KEY]);
        GO

### Column Level Encryption (CLE)
This script creates a symmetric key protected by the asymmetric key in the key vault, and then uses the symmetric key to encrypt data in the database.

    CREATE SYMMETRIC KEY DATA_ENCRYPTION_KEY
    WITH ALGORITHM=AES_256
    ENCRYPTION BY ASYMMETRIC KEY CONTOSO_KEY;

    DECLARE @DATA VARBINARY(MAX);

    --Open the symmetric key for use in this session
    OPEN SYMMETRIC KEY DATA_ENCRYPTION_KEY 
    DECRYPTION BY ASYMMETRIC KEY CONTOSO_KEY;

    --Encrypt syntax
    SELECT @DATA = ENCRYPTBYKEY(KEY_GUID('DATA_ENCRYPTION_KEY'), CONVERT(VARBINARY,'Plain text data to encrypt'));

    -- Decrypt syntax
    SELECT CONVERT(VARCHAR, DECRYPTBYKEY(@DATA));

    --Close the symmetric key
    CLOSE SYMMETRIC KEY DATA_ENCRYPTION_KEY;
