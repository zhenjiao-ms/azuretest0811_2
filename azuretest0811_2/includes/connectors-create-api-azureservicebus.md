To configure the this action, you will need to provide the following information. You will notice that it is easy to use data generated  by the trigger as input for some of the properties for the new file:

| Create file property | Description |

| Folder path |This is the folder (at the Site URL) where the new file will be placed. Browse for and select the folder. |
| File name |This is the name of the file being created. |
| File content |The content that will be written to the file. |
