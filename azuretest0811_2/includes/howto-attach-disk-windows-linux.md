## Attach an empty disk
Attaching an empty disk is a simple way to add a data disk, because Azure creates the .vhd file for you and stores it in the storage account.

1. Click **Virtual Machines**, and then select the appropriate VM.
2. On the command bar, click **Attach**, and then click **Attach Empty Disk**.

    Do the following:

    - In **File Name**, accept the default name or type another one for the .vhd file. The data disk uses an automatically generated name, even if you type another name for the .vhd file.

    - Type the **Size (GB)** of the data disk.

    - Click the check mark to finish.

1. After the data disk is created and attached, it's listed in the dashboard of the VM.

## How to: Attach an existing disk
Attaching an existing disk requires that you have a .vhd available in a storage account. Use the [Add-AzureVhd](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn495173.aspx) cmdlet to upload the .vhd file to the storage account. After you've created and uploaded the .vhd file, you can attach it to a VM.

1. Click **Virtual Machines**, and then select the appropriate virtual machine.
2. On the command bar, click **Attach**, and then select **Attach Disk**.
