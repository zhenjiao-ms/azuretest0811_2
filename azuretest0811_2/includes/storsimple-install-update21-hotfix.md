#### To install and verify regular mode hotfixes
Perform the following steps to install and verify regular-mode hotfixes. If you already installed them using the Azure Portal, skip ahead to [install and verify maintenance mode hotfixes](#to-install-and-verify-maintenance-mode-hotfixes).

1. To install the hotfixes, access the Windows PowerShell interface on your StorSimple device serial console. Follow the detailed instructions in [Use PuTTy to connect to the serial console](../articles/storsimple/storsimple-deployment-walkthrough.md#use-putty-to-connect-to-the-device-serial-console). At the command prompt, press **Enter**.
2. Select **Option 1** to log on to the device with full access. We recommend that you install the hotfix on the passive controller first.
3. To install the hotfix, at the command prompt, type:
   
    `Start-HcsHotfix -Path <path to update file> -Credential <credentials in domain\username format>`
   
    Use IP rather than DNS in share path in the above command. The credential parameter is used only if you are accessing an authenticated share.
   
    We recommend that you use the credential parameter to access shares. Even shares that are open to “everyone” are typically not open to unauthenticated users.
   
    Supply the password when prompted.
   
    A sample output is shown below.
   
        ````
        Controller0>Start-HcsHotfix -Path \\10.100.100.100\share
        \hcsmdssoftwareupdate.exe -Credential contoso\John
   
        Confirm
   
        This operation starts the hotfix installation and could reboot one or
        both of the controllers. If the device is serving I/Os, these will not
        be disrupted. Are you sure you want to continue?
        [Y] Yes [N] No [?] Help (default is "Y"): Y
   
        ````
4. Type **Y** when prompted to confirm the hotfix installation.
   
   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > If installing Update 2.2, only install the binary file prefaced with 'all-hcsmdssoftwareudpate'. Do not install the Cis and the MDS agent update prefaced with all-cismdsagentupdatebundle. Failure to do so will result in an error. 
   > 
5. Monitor the update by using the `Get-HcsUpdateStatus` cmdlet. The update will first complete on the passive controller. Once the passive controller is updated, there will be a failover and the update will then get applied on the other controller. The update is complete when both the controllers are updated.
   
    The following sample output shows the update in progress. The `RunInprogress` will be `True` when the update is in progress.
   
        ````
        Controller0>Get-HcsUpdateStatus
        RunInprogress       : True
        LastHotfixTimestamp :
        LastUpdateTimestamp : 5/5/2016 2:04:02 AM
        Controller0Events   :
        Controller1Events   :
   
        ````
   
     The following sample output indicates that the update is finished. The `RunInProgress` will be `False` when the update has completed.
   
        ````
        Controller0>Get-HcsUpdateStatus
        RunInprogress       : False
        LastHotfixTimestamp : 5/17/2016 9:15:55 AM
        LastUpdateTimestamp : 5/17/2016 9:06:07 AM
        Controller0Events   :
        Controller1Events   :
   
        ````
   
   > [!NOTE]
   > Occasionally, the cmdlet reports `False` when the update is still in progress. To ensure that the hotfix is complete, wait for a few minutes, rerun this command and verify that the `RunInProgress` is `False`. If it is, then the hotfix has completed.
   > 
6. After the software update is complete, verify the system software versions. Type:
   
    `Get-HcsSystem`
   
    You should see the following versions:
   
   * `HcsSoftwareVersion: 6.3.9600.17708`
   * `CisAgentVersion: 1.0.9299.0`
   * `MdsAgentVersion: 30.0.4698.16` 
     
     If the version numbers do not change after applying the update, it indicates that the hotfix has failed to apply. Should you see this, please contact [Microsoft Support](../articles/storsimple/storsimple-contact-microsoft-support.md) for further assistance.
     
     > [!IMPORTANT]
     > You must restart the active controller via the `Restart-HcsController` cmdlet before applying the remaining updates. 
     > 
7. Repeat steps 3-5 to install the remaining regular-mode hotfixes.
   
   * The iSCSI update KB3146621
   * The WMI update KB3103616
8. Skip this step if you are updating from Update 2. If you are updating from a version prior to Update 2, you will also need to download:
   
   * The LSI driver KB3121900
   * The Spaceport update KB3090322
   * The Storport update KB3080728

#### To install and verify maintenance mode hotfixes
Use KB3121899 to install disk firmware updates. These are disruptive updates and take around 30 minutes to complete. You can choose to install these in a planned maintenance window by connecting to the device serial console.

Note that if your disk firmware is already up-to-date, you won't need to install these updates. Run the `Get-HcsUpdateAvailability` cmdlet from the device serial console to check if updates are available and whether the updates are disruptive (maintenance mode) or non-disruptive (regular mode) updates.

To install the disk firmware updates, follow the instructions below.

1. Place the device in the Maintenance mode. Note that you should not use Windows PowerShell remoting when connecting to a device in Maintenance mode. Instead run this cmdlet on the device controller when connected through the device serial console. Type:
   
    `Enter-HcsMaintenanceMode`
   
    A sample output is shown below.
   
        Controller0>Enter-HcsMaintenanceMode
        Checking device state...
   
        In maintenance mode, your device will not service IOs and will be disconnected from the Microsoft Azure StorSimple Manager service. Entering maintenance mode will end the current session and reboot both controllers, which takes a few minutes to complete. Are you sure you want to enter maintenance mode?
        [Y] Yes [N] No (Default is "Y"): Y

        Confirm
        This operation starts a hotfix installation and could reboot one or both of the controllers. By installing new updates you agree to, and accept any additional terms associated with, the new functionality listed in the release notes (https://go.microsoft.com/fwLink/?LinkID=613790). Are you sure you want to continue?
        [Y] Yes [N] No (Default is "Y"): Y
        WARNING: Installation is currently in progress. This operation can take several minutes to complete.
3. Monitor the install progress using `Get-HcsUpdateStatus` command. The update is complete when the `RunInProgress` changes to `False`.
4. After the installation is complete, the controller on which the maintenance mode hotfix was installed restarts. Log in as option 1 with full access and verify the disk firmware version. Type:
   
   `Get-HcsFirmwareVersion`
   
   The expected disk firmware versions are:
   
   `XMGG, XGEG, KZ50, F6C2, VR08`
