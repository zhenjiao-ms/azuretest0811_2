1. Clicking **Connect** creates and downloads a Remote Desktop Protocol file (.rdp file). Click **Open** to use this file.
2. You will get a warning that the .rdp is from an unknown publisher. This is normal. In the Remote Desktop window, click **Connect** to continue.

3. In the **Windows Security** window, type the credentials for an account on the virtual machine and then click **OK**.
   
     **Local account** - this is usually the local account user name and password that you specified when you created the virtual machine. In this case, the domain is the name of the virtual machine and it is entered as *vmname*&#92;*username*.  
   
    **Domain joined VM** - if the VM belongs to a domain, enter the user name in the format *Domain*&#92;*Username*. The account also needs to either be in the Administrators group or have been granted remote access privileges to the VM.
   
    **Domain controller** - if the VM is a domain controller, type the user name and password of a domain administrator account for that domain.
4. Click **Yes** to verify the identity of the virtual machine and finish logging on.
