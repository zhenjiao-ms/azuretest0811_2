## Start your PowerShell session
First, you need to have the latest [Azure PowerShell](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt619274.aspx) installed and running. For detailed information, see [How to install and configure Azure PowerShell](../articles/powershell-install-configure.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Many new features of SQL Database are only supported when you are using the [Azure Resource Manager deployment model](../articles/resource-group-overview.md), so examples use the [Azure SQL Database PowerShell cmdlets](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/mt574084.aspx) for Resource Manager. The existing classic deployment model [Azure SQL Database (classic) cmdlets](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn546723.aspx) are supported for backward compatibility, but we recommend you use the Resource Manager cmdlets.

Run the [**Add-AzureRmAccount**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt619267.aspx) cmdlet, and you will be presented with a sign-in screen to enter your credentials. Use the same credentials that you use to sign in to the Azure portal.

    Add-AzureRmAccount

If you have multiple subscriptions, use the [**Set-AzureRmContext**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt619263.aspx) cmdlet to select which subscription your PowerShell session should use. To see what subscription the current PowerShell session is using, run [**Get-AzureRmContext**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt619265.aspx). To see all your subscriptions, run [**Get-AzureRmSubscription**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt619284.aspx).

    Set-AzureRmContext -SubscriptionId '4cac86b0-1e56-bbbb-aaaa-000000000000'
