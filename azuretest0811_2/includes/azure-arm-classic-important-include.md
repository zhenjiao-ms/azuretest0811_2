> Before you work with Azure resources, it's important to understand that Azure currently has two deployment models: Resource Manager, and classic. Make sure you understand [deployment models and tools](../articles/azure-classic-rm.md) before working with any Azure resource. You can view the documentation for different tools by clicking the tabs at the top of this article.
