## Route tables
Route table resources contains routes used to define how traffic flows within your Azure infrastructure. You can use user defined routes (UDR) to send all traffic from a given subnet to a virtual appliance, such as a firewall or intrusion detection system (IDS). You can associate a route table to subnets. 

Route tables contain the following properties.

| Property | Description | Sample values |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **routes** |Collection of user defined routes in the route table |see [user defined routes](#User-defined-routes) |
| **subnets** |Collection of subnets the route table is applied to |see [subnets](#Subnets) |

### User defined routes
You can create UDRs to specify where traffic should be sent to, based on its destination address. You can think of a route as the default gateway definition based on the destination address of a network packet.

UDRs contain the following properties. 

| Property | Description | Sample values |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **addressPrefix** |Address prefix, or full IP address for the destination |192.168.1.0/24, 192.168.1.101 |
| **nextHopType** |Type of device the traffic will be sent to |VirtualAppliance, VPN Gateway, Internet |
| **nextHopIpAddress** |IP address for the next hop |192.168.1.4 |

Sample route table in JSON format:

    {
        "name": "UDR-BackEnd",
        "id": "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/TestRG/providers/Microsoft.Network/routeTables/UDR-BackEnd",
        "etag": "W/\"xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\"",
        "type": "Microsoft.Network/routeTables",
        "location": "westus",
        "properties": {

                    "etag": "W/\"v\"",
                    "properties": {

                        "nextHopType": "VirtualAppliance",
                        "nextHopIpAddress": "192.168.0.4"
                    }
                }
            ],
            "subnets": [
                {
                    "id": "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/TestRG/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/TestVNet/subnets/BackEnd"
                }
            ]
        }
    }
