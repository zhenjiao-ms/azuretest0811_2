<!--TODO: Introduction -->

## Register your application with your AD tenant
First, you will need to register your application with your Active Directory tenant. This will give you a client ID for your application, as well as enable it to receive tokens.

* Sign into the Azure Management Portal.
* In the left hand navigation pane, click on **Active Directory**.
* Select a tenant in which to register the application.
* Click on the **Applications** tab, and click **Add** in the bottom drawer.
* Follow the prompts and create a new application. It doesn't matter if it is a web application or a native application for this tutorial, but if you'd like specific examples for web applications or native applications, check out our quickstarts [here](../articles/active-directory/active-directory-developers-guide.md).
* For Web Applications, provide the **Sign-On URL** which is the base URL of your app, where users can sign in e.g `http://localhost:12345`. The **App ID URI** is a unique identifier for your application. The convention is to use `https://<tenant-domain>/<app-name>`, e.g. `https://contoso.onmicrosoft.com/my-first-aad-app`
* For Native Applications, provide a **Redirect URI**, which Azure AD will use to return token responses. Enter a value specific to your application, .e.g `http://MyFirstAADApp`
* Once you've completed registration, AAD will assign your application a unique client identifier. You will need this value in the next sections, so copy it in the **Configure** tab of your application.
