    1. Create a Data Lake Analytics account.
    2. Prepare the source data. Data Lake Analytic jobs can read data from either Azure Data Lake Store accounts or Azure Blob storage accounts.   
    3. Develop a U-SQL script.
    4. Submit a job (U-SQL script) to the Data Lake Analytics account. The job reads from the source data, process the data as instructed in the U-SQL script, and then save the output to either a Data Lake Store account or a Blob storage account.
