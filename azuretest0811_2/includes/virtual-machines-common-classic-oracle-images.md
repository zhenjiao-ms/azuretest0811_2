To create virtual machines based on Oracle images, sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), click **Marketplace**, click **Compute**, and then type **Oracle** into the Search box. Select an image and follow the instructions to set up the image on Microsoft Azure. Note that Oracle images by Microsoft on the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) run on Windows, and Oracle images by Oracle run on Oracle Linux.

## Windows-based virtual machine images
The following is a list of the available Oracle virtual machine images that run on Windows Server on Azure. These images are pay-as-you-go, meaning that Oracle license fees are included in the usage of these images. Microsoft no longer publishes Oracle Database or WebLogic images in Azure Marketplace.  You can still create your own custom image and use the Bring Your Own License model in order to run Oracle software on Microsoft Azure. 

### Java virtual machine images
* JDK 8 on Windows Server 2012 R2
* JDK 7 on Windows Server 2012
* JDK 6 on Windows Server 2012

## Oracle Linux virtual machine images
The following is a list of the available preconfigured Oracle virtual machine images that run on Oracle Linux on Azure. You are expected to bring your own license for these images, as Oracle license fees are not included in the usage of these preconfigured virtual machine images. You can also bring your own license to install and run Oracle software on custom virtual machines on Windows or Linux. Here are complete details on [Oracle licensing on Azure](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/cloud/faq-1963009.html#support). And here are details on creating virtual machines using [your own images](../articles/virtual-machines/virtual-machines-windows-classic-createupload-vhd.md). To learn about this and other methods of migrating Oracle and other workloads to Azure, see [Different ways to create a Windows-based virtual machine](../articles/virtual-machines/virtual-machines-windows-creation-choices.md).
