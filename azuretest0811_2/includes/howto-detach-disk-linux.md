When you no longer need a data disk that's attached to a virtual machine (VM), you can easily detach it. This removes the disk from the VM, but doesn't remove it from storage. If you want to use the existing data on the disk again, you can reattach it to the same VM, or another one.  

> [!NOTE]
> A VM in Azure uses different types of disks - an operating system disk, a local temporary disk, and optional data disks. For details, see [About Disks and VHDs for Virtual Machines](../articles/virtual-machines/virtual-machines-linux-about-disks-vhds.md). It's not possible to detach an operating system disk unless you also delete the VM.

## Find the disk
Before you can detach a disk from a VM you need to find out the LUN number, which is an identifier for the disk to be detached. To do that, follow these steps:

1. Open Azure CLI and [connect to your Azure subscription](../articles/xplat-cli-connect.md). Make sure you are in Azure Service Management mode (`azure config mode asm`).
2. Find out which disks are attached to your VM by using `azure vm disk list
   <virtual-machine-name>`:
   
    $azure vm disk list UbuntuVM
    info:    Executing command vm disk list
   
   * Fetching disk images
   * Getting virtual machines
   * Getting VM disks
     data:    Lun  Size(GB)  Blob-Name                         OS
     data:    ---  --------  --------------------------------  -----
     data:         30        ubuntuVM-2645b8030676c8f8.vhd  Linux
     data:    1    10        test.VHD
     data:    0    30        ubuntuVM-76f7ee1ef0f6dddc.vhd
     info:    vm disk list command OK
3. Note the LUN or the **logical unit number** for the disk that you want to detach.

## Remove operating system references to the disk
Prior to detaching the disk from the Linux guest, you should identify all partitions on the disk are not in use and ensure that the operating system will not attempt to re-mount them after a reboot. These steps undo the configuration you likely created when [attaching](../articles/virtual-machines/virtual-machines-linux-classic-attach-disk.md) the disk.

1. Use the `lsscsi` command to discover the disk identifier. `lsscsi` can be installed by either `yum install lsscsi` (on Red Hat based distributions) or `apt-get install lsscsi` (on Debian based distributions). You can find the disk identifier you are looking for by using the LUN number above. The last number in the tuple in each row is the LUN. In the example below LUN 0 maps to */dev/sdc*
   
            ops@TestVM:~$ lsscsi
            [1:0:0:0]    cd/dvd  Msft     Virtual CD/ROM   1.0   /dev/sr0
            [2:0:0:0]    disk    Msft     Virtual Disk     1.0   /dev/sda
            [3:0:1:0]    disk    Msft     Virtual Disk     1.0   /dev/sdb
            [5:0:0:0]    disk    Msft     Virtual Disk     1.0   /dev/sdc
            [5:0:0:1]    disk    Msft     Virtual Disk     1.0   /dev/sdd
2. Use `fdisk -l <disk>` to discovery the partitions associated with the disk to be detached.
3. $ sudo fdisk -l /dev/sdc
   Disk /dev/sdc: 1098.4 GB, 1098437885952 bytes, 2145386496 sectors
   Units = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
   Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
   I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
   Disk label type: dos
   Disk identifier: 0x5a1d2a1a
   
      Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
   /dev/sdc1            2048  2145386495  1072692224   83  Linux
4. Unmount each partition listed for the disk. In this example: `$ sudo umount /dev/sdc1`
5. Use the `blkid` command to discovery the UUIDs for all partitions
   
            $ sudo blkid
            /dev/sda1: UUID="11111111-1b1b-1c1c-1d1d-1e1e1e1e1e1e" TYPE="ext4"
            /dev/sdb1: UUID="22222222-2b2b-2c2c-2d2d-2e2e2e2e2e2e" TYPE="ext4"
            /dev/sdc1: UUID="33333333-3b3b-3c3c-3d3d-3e3e3e3e3e3e" TYPE="ext4"
            /dev/sdd1: UUID="44444444-4b4b-4c4c-4d4d-4e4e4e4e4e4e" TYPE="ext4
6. Remove entries in the **/etc/fstab** file associated with either the device paths or UUIDs for all partitions for the disk to be detached.  Entries for this example might be:
   
        UUID=33333333-3b3b-3c3c-3d3d-3e3e3e3e3e3e   /datadrive   ext4   defaults   1   2
   or
   
        /dev/sdc1   /datadrive   ext4   defaults   1   2

## Detach the disk
After you find the LUN number of the disk and removed the operating system references, you're ready to detach it:

1. Detach the selected disk from the virtual machine by running the command `azure vm disk detach
   <virtual-machine-name> <LUN>`:
   
    $azure vm disk detach UbuntuVM 0
    info:    Executing command vm disk detach
   
   * Getting virtual machines
   * Removing Data-Disk
     info:    vm disk detach command OK
2. You can check if the disk got detached by running this command:
   
    $azure vm disk list UbuntuVM
    info:    Executing command vm disk list
   
   * Fetching disk images
   * Getting virtual machines
   * Getting VM disks
     data:    Lun  Size(GB)  Blob-Name                         OS
     data:    ---  --------  --------------------------------  -----
     data:         30        ubuntuVM-2645b8030676c8f8.vhd  Linux
     data:    1    10        test.VHD
     info:    vm disk list command OK

The detached disk remains in storage but is no longer attached to a virtual machine.
