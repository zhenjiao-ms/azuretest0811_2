## Scenario
This document will walk through a deployment that uses a static public IP address allocated to a virtual machine (VM). In this scenario, you have a single VM with its own static public IP address. The VM is part of a subnet named **FrontEnd** and also has a static private IP address (**192.168.1.101**) in that subnet.

You may need a static IP address for web servers that require SSL connections in which the SSL certificate is linked to an IP address.
