> Azure CLI support for managing HDInsight resources using Azure Service Manager (ASM) is **deprecated**, and will be removed by January 1, 2017. The steps in this document use the new Azure CLI commands that work with Azure Resource Manager (ARM).
> 
> Please follow the steps in [Install and configure Azure CLI](../articles/xplat-cli-install.md) to install the latest version of the Azure CLI. If you have scripts that need to be modified to use the new commands that work with Azure Resource Manager, see [Migrating to Azure Resource Manager-based development tools for HDInsight clusters](../articles/hdinsight/hdinsight-hadoop-development-using-azure-resource-manager.md) for more information.
