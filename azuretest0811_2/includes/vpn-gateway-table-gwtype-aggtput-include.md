* (1) The VPN throughput is a rough estimate based on the measurements between VNets in the same Azure region. It is not a guarantee of what you can get for cross-premises connections across the Internet, but should be used as a maximum possible measure.
* (2) The number of tunnels refer to route-based VPN below. A policy-based VPN can only support one Site-to-Site VPN tunnel.
* (3) The High Performance SKU is not supported for the policy-based VPN type.
